The fallopian tube has an identifiable fimbriated end.  Multiple paratubal cysts are noted measuring 0.2 up to 0.4 cm.  There are no excrescences along its serosal surface.  The tube is serially sectioned to reveal a pinpoint lumen with yellow/tan micropapillary structures inside.   The ovary is gray/tan and bosselated, however it is received disrupted.  There are small excrescences on its surface.  It is serially sectioned to reveal solid yellow/tan spiculated areas.  It is difficult to ascertain normal ovary versus ovary involved by tumor. Measurements: Fallopian tube:  4.5 cm length x 0.5 cm diameter Ovary:  3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm Solid area:  3.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm Representative sections: C1  FS2, entirely resubmitted in biowrap C2-C4  representative sections of ovary C5  representative section of fallopian tube Specimen D is received in formalin labeled left tube and ovary and consists of the aforementioned which weigh 14.9 grams post fixation. The fallopian tube has an identifiable fimbriated end.  No paratubal cysts are noted.  There are no excrescences along its serosal surface.  The tube is serially sectioned. It is dilated at the fimbriated end with small papillary structures within the lumen.   The ovary is gray/tan and bosselated.  It is received intact without excrescences on its surface.  It is serially sectioned to reveal a predominantly heterologous cut surface with a single white/tan solid area that is 0.6 cm in greatest dimension. The majority of ovarian tissue appears grossly unremarkable.  Attached to the tube and ovary is a rubbery mass that measures 3.2 x 2 x 1.0 cm. Measurements: Fallopian tube:   4.4 cm length x 0.6 cm diameter Ovary:   2.5 x 2.2 x 1.1 cm Representative sections: D1-D3  entire ovary D4  representative tube with fimbriae D5  representative rubbery mass Specimen E is received fresh for frozen section labeled uterine fundus (FS3) and consists of the aforementioned. The serosa is pink/tan with several small white/tan nodules on the surface. Sectioning of the endomyometrium reveals a papillary, friable light brown tumor involving the entire endometrium.  It measures 11.9 x 5 x 1 cm.  The lesion grossly appears to have small deposits within the myometrium. The lesion appears to be occluding the internal os.   Measurements: Specimen weight:  210.7 grams (fresh) Dimensions of uterus:  7.8 cm (length) x 7.1 cm (width) x 6.2 cm (ant-post)  Depth of endometrial cavity:  5.5 cm Tumor/Polyp dimensions:  11.9 cm (greatest) x 5 cm (smaller) x 1 cm (max thickness)      Percent of endometrial surface involvement:  at least 99% Uninvolved endometrial thickness:  not applicable Uninvolved myometrial thickness:  myometrial deposit  Internal os diameter:  occluded by tumor Representative sections: E1  right parametrium E2  left parametrium E3  FS3, entirely resubmitted in biowrap E4  anterior endomyometrium E5  anterior lower uterine segment E6  posterior endomyometrium E7  posterior lower uterine segment E8  uterine fundus E9-E10  representative sections of tumor Specimen label:  F) sigmoid serosal biopsy Fixation: formalin Number of pieces: one Shape(s): irregular Color(s): red/tan Consistency: soft, rubbery Size(s): 1.5 x 1 x 0.6 cm Cassette summary: entirely submitted in cassette F1 Specimen G is received in formalin labeled sigmoid colon and tumor and it consists of a partially opened segment of bowel measuring 6.9 x 4.1 x 3.9 cm.  The specimen is unoriented. There are two staple lines; one measuring 3.5 cm and the other measuring 3.9 cm.  The external surface of the bowel is red/tan and injected. The attached mesentery is yellow/tan and smooth. There are several white/tan nodules identified on the serosal surface and the mesentery. Upon palpation of the bowel wall there are multiple indurated nodules. The largest of these is closest to staple line #2 and measures 3 cm in greatest dimension. There is a 0.4cm mucosal ulcer corresponding to this mass. The remainder of the bowel mucosa is yellow/tan and normally rugated  Representative sections:   G1  staple line #1 G2  staple line #2 G3-G4  representative sections of largest nodule with mucosal ulceration G5-G6  representative sections of serosal nodules Specimen H is received in formalin labeled cervix and consists of the Result information is incomplete.

The wedge of lung measures 10 cm in length by 2.5 cm in width by 2.5 cm in thickness. There is an obvious tumor eroding through the pleural surface on this wedge and this area of ulceration measures 3.1 cm in diameter. Cut surface of the pulmonary wedge reveals a whitish what is suspected to be tumor mass measuring 2.1 x 0.7 cm. Representative sections of this mass are submitted in cassettes 1A-1C and in cassettes 1D-1F are submitted the entirety of the segment of rib after decalcification.   Specimen 2 received fresh for frozen section labeled right chest wall margins is a 139.8 gram, 15.0 x 6.0 x 3.0 cm gray/white soft tissue mass including three segments of rib. The outer surface of the ribs are inked black and sectioning reveals a gray/white soft cut surface. The soft tissue mass has overall dimensions of 8.0 x 5.0 x 2.5 cm and appears to invade through the rib and abuts the black inked resection margin. No lung tissue is identified. A representative section is submitted for frozen section, now resubmitted in cassette 2A. Additional representative sections of the mass to include the rib and black inked soft tissue resection margin are submitted in cassettes 2B-2I following decalcification.   Specimen 3 received in formalin labeled chest right mass for permanent and consists of a small mass of tissue with an apparent muscular and adipose component. The tissue measures 2 x 1 x 0.8 cm. It is sectioned sequentially and submitted in toto in cassette 3A.  Specimen 4 received in formalin labeled head of fourth rib for permanent and consists of three masses of bony tissue having an aggregate dimension of 4 x 3 x 1 cm. It is representatively submitted after decalcification in cassette 4.   Specimen 5 received in formalin labeled head of third rib for permanent and consists of a segment of rib measuring 2.1 cm in length by 2 cm in width by 1.1 cm in thickness. The specimen is decalcified and submitted in toto in cassette 5.  Specimen 6 received in formalin labeled level 10 lymph node for permanent and consists of a small mass of soft tissue grossly consistent with an anthracotic node. It measures 1.1 cm in width by 1.5 cm in length by 0.3 cm in thickness. The specimen is submitted in toto in a single cassette 6.   Specimen 7 received fresh for frozen section labeled right upper lobe and consists of a 100 gram mass of soft tissue grossly consistent with a right upper lobe with multiple staple lines. The bronchial margin has been previously submitted. The lobe is breadloaf sectioned thoroughly and no residual tumor is seen within it. Representative sections of the vascular margin are submitted in cassette 7B and representative sections of random areas of the lung lobe submitted in cassettes C-E.  Specimen 8 received in formalin labeled level 4R lymph node and consists of a very tiny mass of soft tissue that has what appears to be a small tiny palpable node within it measuring approximately 3 mm in diameter. The specimen is submitted in a single cassette 8.  Specimen 9 received in formalin labeled level 9R lymph node and consists of a small fragment of adipose with what appears to be a gross node measuring approximately 4 mm in diameter and is submitted in toto in a single cassette 9.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections from the right upper lobe wedge biopsy show infiltrating poorly differentiating neoplasm with extensive necrosis. The neoplastic cells vary from epithelioid to spindled with large vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Focal keratinization is observed. The tumor extends into the chest wall, involving the visceral and parietal pleura. Angiolymphatic permeation by neoplasm is noted. Sections through the rib show neoplasm within soft tissue proper.  Sections through specimen 2 show the frozen section control to be free of neoplasm. Sections which include rib and surrounding soft tissue show evidence of neoplasm extending through the soft tissue and into the rib. The margin of resection is approximately 3-5 mm from the inked surgical margin. Again, areas of angiolymphatic permeation by neoplasm are noted.  Sections from specimen 3 show infiltrating neoplasm similar to that described above within soft tissue. There is a 1 mm margin as can be best discerned.  Sections through specimen 4 designated head of fourth rib show an area of reactive marrow containing neoplasm with background reactive marrow which includes some small lymphoid aggregates.  Sections through specimen 5, designated head of third rib show reactive appearing bone with marrow which is normocellular and contains some small lymphoid aggregates. This is free of neoplasm.  Sections from specimen 6 show a lymph node with anthracotic pigmentation and sinus histiocytosis. There is no evidence of metastatic neoplasm.  Sections from the bronchial margin show no evidence of neoplasm. The additional sections of lung submitted show areas of pleural fibrosis and emphysematous change. There is no evidence of neoplasm. A single lymph node identified shows no evidence of neoplasm.  Sections through specimen 8 show lymph node with anthrasilicosis and without evidence of neoplasm.  Sections from specimen 9 show two lymph nodes without evidence of metastatic carcinoma.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[CCC M. ZZZ], M.D. Procedures/Addenda\n"

The tumor is present at the posterior supracervical margin of excision.  \n\nIn part C, there is transmural extension of the tumor.  The tumor extends to the distal margin.  Lymphovascular space invasion by tumor is present. \n\nImmunohistochemical stains show the tumor to be positive for cytokeratin 7 and estrogen receptor.  The tumor is negative for cytokeratin 20, CDX2, WT-1, Oscar, LCA and p63.  The cytokeratin 7+/ cytokeratin 20- phenotype is seen in tumors of the gynecologic tract and are not consistent with a gastrointestinal primary.  The ER positivity lends further support for a gynecologic primary.  The tumor does not appear to be arising from the endometrium or the ovaries and is predominately located within the cervical/endocervical region.  Additional immunohistochemical stains to further classify this tumor are pending and will be reported separately.\n\nSpecimen signed out at **INSTITUTION for **STREET-ADDRESS, **PLACE, HI **ZIP-CODE.\nGrossDescription:\nSpecimen A:  Received in the fresh state, labeled \"recto-uterus junction\" is an irregular piece of rubbery pink-tan tissue (2 x 2 x 1.4 cm).

The entire specimen is submitted as follows:\n\nBlock summary:\nA1.  -  Piece from frozen section.\nA2-A4.  -  Remainder.\n\nSpecimen B:  Received in formalin, labeled \"uterus and right fallopian tube and ovary\" is a supracervical hysterectomy specimen (70.5 grams) consisting of a uterus with an attached right fallopian tube and right ovary.  The right fallopian tube is tan-red with a fimbriated end and measures 6.5 x 1.1 x 1 cm and has multiple adherent paratubal cysts ranging from 0.2 to 0.7 cm in greatest dimension.  The right ovary is tan-red and measures 3.2 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm and upon sectioning reveals a few cystic cavities measuring up to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension.  The uterus measures 5.5 x 5.5 x 4 cm and has a smooth, tan-red serosal surface.  The uterus is bivalved and sectioned.  Endometrium (0.1 to 0.2 cm in thickness) is soft, tan-red.  Myometrium (1.2 to 1.7 cm in thickness) is pink-tan and reveals two rubbery white nodules (0.6 and 0.9 cm in greatest dimension).

The distal end of the specimen is left open and inked black.  The proximal end of the specimen is stapled.  The staples are removed and the revised proximal resection margin is inked red.  The radial/mesenteric resection margin is inked green.  The circumferential serosal margin is inked yellow.  An apparent circumferential ulcerated tan-red polypoid mass (approximately 7 x 5 x 1.2 cm) with a tan-white exudate is found at the distal aspect of the specimen.  The mass possibly extends to the distal resection margin on the circumferential serosal aspect and grossly approaches 2.5 cm within the distal resection margin on the mucosal aspect.  The mass is also found 3.5 cm away from the proximal resection margin and 0.5 cm away from the radial/mesenteric resection margin.  The mass grossly appears to protrude through the muscularis propria.  Also found in the same container is an additional piece of tan-red tissue/probable mass (3.3 x 2 x 1.2 cm).

The specimen includes 10 cm of cecum and 4 cm of ileum.  An ulcerated tumor is noted within the cecum that measures 2.7 x 2 cm.  This is at least 1.3 cm from the surgical margin (not including additional tissue from the anastomosis.  On section the ulcerated tumor appears to extend into a thickened muscularis.  However, definite gross extension into the peri-colic fat is not appreciated.  Representative sections of tumor are submitted in cassettes 1 through 3.  Representative sections of the surgical margins submitted in cassette 4.  The vermiform appendix measures up to 2 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm and is grossly unremarkable.  Representative sections submitted in cassette 5.  Possible lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes 6 through 9.  Additional sections of tumor are submitted in cassettes 10 and 11.  Additional possible lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes 12 through 14.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nRight colon:  Tumor is characterized by a cribriform pattern with areas of necrosis.  Solid sheet-like areas are not appreciated.  In the initial three sections, tumor does not appear to extend through the muscularis propria.  Neither vascular nor neural invasion is noted.  The surgical margins appear free of tumor.  The vermiform appendix is free of malignancy.  Sixteen regional lymph nodes are negative for metastatic carcinoma.\nA: Right colon\nAddendumComment:\nPlease see the attached Clarient report for KRAS results (***PATH-NUMBER[1]; **DATE[Aug 20 2011]).\n"

However, because the pleural surface was incised during surgery (received non-intact), the possibility of pleural invasion, and therefore higher T stage, cannot be excluded with certainty.  Final staging must be performed by the oncologist/surgeon in correlation with all pathologic, imaging, surgical and clinical information.   **INITIALS  Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[ZZZ], M.D., **NAME[YYY]\nGross Description 1: Received fresh for frozen section designated \\\"wedge right upper lobe\\\" is a 52 gram, 7.0 x 7.0 x 3.5 cm wedge biopsy of lung tissue which has been previously partially incised and displays staple margin up to 11.0 cm in length.  In the area where the pleural surface has been previously incised, there is a subpleural tumor nodule measuring 1.7 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.  There appears to be some possible puckering of the overlying pleural surface but this is difficult to determine due to the previous incision made during surgery.  The edge of the tumor measures 1.0 cm from the closest stapled margin which will be inked.  After removing the staple line, a frozen section of tumor and closest parenchymal margin is frozen in one block with control submitted as FSC1A.  The remainder of the tumor is submitted in blocks 1A-1C (parenchymal margin inked yellow, pleural surface inked violet).  Lung tissue adjacent to the tumor is submitted in block 1D and 1E.  Sectioning through the remainder of the lung tissue reveals no other discrete focal lesions.  Representative sections away from the tumor are submitted in blocks 1F-1H. 2: Received fresh designated \\\"Precision specimen\\\" are two irregular pieces of red brown lung tissue measuring 2.0 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm and 1.5 x 1.0 x 1.0 cm.  Each piece is submitted separately in appropriate media for ChemoFx and biomarkers to Precision study, as requested by the surgeon.   **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Incorporated in diagnosis. For the special stain (Elastic), the corresponding control reacts appropriately. Although the elastica of the pleura is attenuated, invasion of tumor through the elastica is not identified.

The smear shows adequate cellularity. The ThinPrep slide shows cohesive groups of non-small cells having uniform nuclear features. The cell block slides show cores of tissue largely effaced by an adenocarcinoma with a lipidic growth pattern, invasive component cannot be excluded. Immunohistochemistry performed by Laboratories Northwest shows the lesional cells expressing cytokeratin 7 and TTF-1 and not expressing cytokeratin 20. The immunohistochemical profile is consistent with a pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

Tumor forms solid nests and exhibits a single cell pattern of infiltration.  Individual tumor cells are pleomorphic, with cytoplasmic vacuoles and occasional signet ring cells.  No in situ carcinoma component is identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.  The tissue fragments with tumor range in size from 0.2 to 0.6cm.  \n\n  E cadherin immunohistochemical stain is performed.  Some tumors cells are immunoreactive with E cadherin and others are negative.  This pattern is supportive of infiltrating mammary carcinoma with mixed ductal and lobular features. \n\n  This case was reviewed at the Pathology Departmental Conference and was also reviewed intradepartmentally with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY].  Dr. **NAME[M. XXX] was notified of these findings on **DATE[Jan 7 2013] at 10:15 AM.\n\nER/PR HERCEPTEST (QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION)\nEstrogen and Progesterone Receptor analysis and the Herceptest (DAKO) for HER2 protein overexpression are performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block 1A) using immunohistochemical techniques.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TECHNICAL INFORMATION: \nDeparaffinized sections of tissue are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies, along with appropriate positive controls.  Localization is via a biotin free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody.  The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.\n\nSUMMATION OF FINDINGS: \nThe Estrogen Receptor (VECTOR CLONE 6F11) is positive in 99% of the tumor cells showing strong (3+) staining intensity.  The Progesterone Receptor (DAKO Clone PgR 636) is positive in 99% of the tumor cells showing strong (3+) staining intensity.  The Herceptest (DAKO) shows equivocal (1+ to 2+) staining, after evaluation of membrane staining intensity and pattern on the standardized  0 to 3+ scale.  Her2 neu by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) will be performed on the tissue block and reported in an addendum.\n\nNOTE:   Positive Estrogen Receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.  Positive Progesterone receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.\n\nImmunohistochemical estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor test results are reported using the ASCO CAP scoring criteria.  If positive, staining intensity may be reported numerically 1, 2, 3+ or descriptively as weak, moderate or strong. \n\nNOTE:   ASCO/CAP scoring criteria for HER2 protein over expression by immunohistochemistry are as stated: Positive cases show strong and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive cancer cells (score 3).  Negative cases are defined as those with no staining (score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (score 1).  Equivocal or indeterminate cases show strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells or less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells.  \n\nPQRS CODE: 3394F\n\n\nGrossDescription:\n  Received in formalin labeled ultrasound guided right breast core biopsy at 9:30 are 10 cylindrical, tan, white to yellow, fibrofatty tissues ranging from 0.2 x 0.2cm to 1.5 x 0.2cm.  The specimen is submitted in its entirety as 1A and 1B.\n\nFixation of specimen reviewed and assured to be 6 to 48 hours. \nMM:lefb **DATE[Jan 6 2013].\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  Slides reviewed.\n1: Right breast core biopsy\n"

SOFT TISSUE, BOWEL SURFACE IMPLANT; RESECTION:\n     -    SEROUS CARCINOMA, HIGH GRADE.\n\nAMENDMENT COMMENT:\n**DATE[Jun 16 2012]: The report is amended to correct the origin of the serous\ncarcinoma which was originally stated to be the right ovary. Upon\nre-review, the right ovary is without abnormalities grossly and\nhistologically. The sites of the serous carcinoma are all peritoneal\nsurfaces or implants on visceral organs. It is concluded that the origin of\nthe serous carcinoma is the peritoneum.\n\nINTRAOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:\nFSA.  Transverse colon mesenteric mass:  consistent with endometrial\nadenocarcinoma (**INITIALS).\nFSB.  (on specimen D), Uterus, tubes and ovaries: Uterus/endometrium: Clear\ncell carcinoma, left ovary with clear\n          cell carcinoma.    (XX/XX)\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: five, each labeled with\npatient name **NAME[AAA BBB] and medical record number XXXXX\nA.

Sectioning reveals tan-gray\nfirm nodules surrounded by unilobulated adipose tissue.  Sectioning reveals\ntan friable homogenous cut surfaces as well as a 2.3 x 1.5 x 1.2 cm\nhemorrhagic cyst.  Submitted for frozen section diagnosis on **DATE[Jun 8 2012] at\n8:28.  Time done:  8;45.  The remainder of the frozen section submitted for\npermanent block in cassette A3.  Representative sections as follows:  A1\nfriable nodule; A2   cystic area and nodule; A3   frozen section remainder.\nB.   Container designation: \"peritoneal implant, small bowel\" --  Received\nfresh for frozen section is a 0.7 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm portion of a firm tan and\nyellow nodule.  The specimen is bisected to reveal a tan and firm cut\nsurface.  Entirely submitted is submitted in cassette B1.\nC.   Container designation: \"omentum\"   Contains a 255 gm, 27 x 18 x 3 cm\nportion of omentum.  The specimen is remarkable for two (3.5 x 3 x 1.5 cm,\n3 x 2.5 x 2 cm) white firm nodules surrounded by area of puckering.  The\nsurrounding area is inked in black and serially sectioned to reveal white\nfirm glistening cut surfaces.  Representative in six cassettes as follows:\nC1-C5   representative of firm nodules; C6   possibly uninvolved section.\nD.   Container designation: \"uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries\"\n--  Received is a 152 grams hysterectomy specimen that measures 11.5 cm\nfrom cervix to fundus, 7.5 cm from cornu to cornu and 4.5 cm from anterior\nto posterior.  The bilateral tubes and ovaries are attached.  The cervix is\ntan, smooth and glistening and unremarkable, with a slit-like os measuring\n1.5 cm in internal diameter.  The specimen is bivalved to reveal a\ntriangular endometrial cavity that measures 5.0 x 2.4 cm, and is remarkable\nfor a 2.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm red, hemorrhagic exophytic mass.  The remainder of\nthe endometrial cavity is lined by a pink, smooth glistening mucosa.  The\nanterior portion of the endometrial cavity just prior to the lower uterine\nsegment is remarkable for a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm exophytic mass. The specimen\nis serially sectioned to reveal tan-white whorled nodule that ranges from\n1.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm up to 4.5 x 3.0 x 4.0 cm.  Sectioning of the nodule\nreveals  a focally hemorrhagic area.  The external surface of the specimen\nis pink, smooth and intact with an area of cautery surrounding the cervix.\nThe left fallopian tube measures 6.0 cm in length with an average external\ndiameter of 0.8 cm and is fimbriated.  The ovary measures 4.0 x 3.5 x 3.0\ncm, is smooth and tan.  Sectioning reveals a firm nodular mass, part of\nwhich has been submitted for frozen section.  The area surrounding the\nadnexa is remarkable for papillary excrescences and a single firm nodule\nmeasuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm.  The right fimbriated fallopian tube measures\n6.0 cm in length with an average external diameter of 0.3 cm.  Sectioning\nof both the fallopian tubes reveals a pinpoint unremarkable lumen.  The\nright ovary measures 3.0 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.  Sectioning reveals yellow and tan\ncut surfaces with possible corpus luteum.  Please note that a small portion\nof ovarian and endometrial tissue is submitted for XXXXX.  Cassette summary:\nD1-anterior ectocervix; D2-posterior ectocervix; D3-anterior lower uterine\nsegment; D4-posterior lower uterine segment; D5-uninvolved anterior\nendomyometrium, full-thickness section; D6-D8 are sections of posterior\nendometrium with mass;; D9 and D10-whorled nodule; D11-left ovary and\nfimbriated fallopian tube; D12 and D13-ovary; D14-right ovary and fallopian\ntube; D15-papillary excrescences surrounding adnexa; D16-remainder of\nfrozen section (endometrium FSB); D17- frozen section remnant (FSB) of left\novary.\nE.

Received, appropriately labeled with the patient's name and designated as 'brush biopsy of right mainstem bronchus,' is fluid submitted in CytoLyt fixative, which is used to make one monolayer preparation slide labeled as A1.  Also received are six slides in alcohol, which are subsequently Pap stained and labeled as A2-A7.\nB.  Received, appropriately labeled with the patient's name and designated as 'bronchial washing #1,' is fluid submitted in CytoLyt fixative, which is used to make one monolayer preparation slide labeled as B1.\nC.  Received, appropriately labeled with the patient's name and designated as 'bronchial wash #2,' is fluid submitted in CytoLyt fixative used to make one monolayer preparation slide and one cell block slide, labeled as C1&C1-1, respectively.\nD.  Received, appropriately labeled with the patient's name and designated as 'bronchial wash #3,' is fluid in CytoLyt fixative, which is used to make one monolayer preparation slide and one cell block slide, labeled as D1&D1-1.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Feb 9 12]\nE.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'forceps biopsy right mainstem bronchus' are seven red-tan soft tissue fragments 0.2 to 0.4 cm in maximum dimension.  The specimen is wrapped and submitted its entirety in cassette E1.\nCO/jw  **DATE[Feb 8 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nA.  The right mainstem bronchus brushing specimen, monolayer preparation slide, and direct smear slides demonstrate several fragments of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma.\nB.  The monolayer preparation slide from the bronchial washing #1 is of low cellularity consisting of rare inflammatory cells and debris.  No atypical or malignant cells are identified.\nC.  The monolayer preparation slide and the cell block slide from the bronchial washing #2 specimen demonstrates small crushed fragments of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma.\nD.  The monolayer preparation slide and the cell block slide from the bronchial washing #3 specimen demonstrates small crushed fragments of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma.\nE.  The right mainstem bronchus biopsy specimen demonstrates poorly differentiated neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma characterized by aggregates of malignant cells with characteristic crush artifact, individual cell necrosis, and mitotic activity.  Immunohistochemical analysis was performed and this carcinoma was evaluated with broad spectrum cytokeratin (OSCAR), chromogranin A, synaptophysin, and TTF-1 immunostains.  The OSCAR and TTF-1 immunostains are strongly positive and the chromogranin-A and synpatophysin immunostains are focally and weakly positive.  The immunohistochemical findings confirm the diagnosis in this case.\n**INITIALS  **DATE[Feb 9 12]\n\n\n<FINAL DX>\nA.  RIGHT MAINSTEM BRONCHUS, BRUSHING:\n  POORLY DIFFERENTIATED NEUROENDOCRINE (SMALL CELL) CARCINOMA.\nB.  BRONCHIAL WASHING #1:\n  NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.\nC.  BRONCHIAL WASHING #2:\n  POORLY DIFFERENTIATED NEUROENDOCRINE (SMALL CELL) CARCINOMA.\nD.  BRONCHIAL WASHING #3:\n  POORLY DIFFERENTIATED NEUROENDOCRINE (SMALL CELL) CARCINOMA.\nE.  RIGHT MAINSTEM BRONCHUS, BIOPSY:\n  POORLY DIFFERENTIATED NEUROENDOCRINE (SMALL CELL) CARCINOMA.\n\n<DX COMMENT>\nResults of this case were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Feb 9 12] at 1530 hours.\n"

LUL - Labeled \"B\", 20 mL  fluid; one ThinPrep slide is prepared.\n\n\n<COMMENT>\n\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nThe left upper lobe bronchial lavage on slide B ThinPrep contains scattered cells in which nuclei are enlarged and hyperchromatic. These changes are suspicious for malignant cells.  The H&E-stained sections of the left upper lobe biopsies on slides A show bronchial wall biopsies with one of the five biopsies containing submucosal collections of neoplastic cells which, on an H&E-stained basis, show both squamous and adenocarcinomatous features. There is no small cell undifferentiated carcinomatous change seen. I discussed these findings with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] and noted that immunohistochemistry would be performed. The block was subjected to testing for CK7, CK5/6, CK20, CDX-2 (because the CEA was elevated into the 60's), p63 and TTF-1. Using standard techniques, the controls are noted to stain appropriately. The cells of interest are present on these immunohistochemical stains. The involvement is noted to be limited to a single biopsy. The cells of interest are TTF-1, CDX-2 and CK20 negative. They are strongly CK7 positive. There is definite p63 positivity, and the CK5/6 shows focal weak positivity. This pattern helps support a diagnosis of primary pulmonary carcinoma. The limited amount of tumor tissue makes it difficult to definitely classify this as to whether or not it represents squamous versus an adenosquamous carcinoma. Based on the limited amount of tissue present, I slightly favor classifying this as a poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. A larger tumor sample is necessary for definitive classification. Tandem control samples demonstrated proper staining characteristics. Some of the above tests may use analyte-specific reagents; they have not been cleared or approved by the FDA. These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by PAKC/DSL. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research.\n\n<FINAL DX>\n (BASED ON LIGHT MICROSCOPY AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY) \nB.

Immunohistochemical stains for CK7, CK20 and CDX2 are performed on block A4.  The tumor stains strongly positive for CK7 and CK20.   CK7 is focally positive.  The immunostaining pattern combined with the histologic appearance of the tumor favors the diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma likely from intestinal primary. Clinical correlation is recommended. The case was reviewed at the daily intradepartmental consensus conference, with the agreement to the above diagnosis.    This service has been rendered in part by a resident.  A pathologist has personally reviewed the slides/tissue and has rendered and is responsible for the diagnosis that appears on the report.  The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

There is no attached skin.  There is an inserted localizing wire including tip.  The specimen margins are inked in blue.  Also received is a specimen radiograph of the circled area of concern which includes an inserted marker clips near the hook of the wire.  On sectioning, situated within the area of concern, is a 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm firm yellow and focally hemorrhagic region.  There is also a small amount of surrounding indurated white fibrous areas.  This area of induration extends to within less than 1 mm of the inked margins.  The entire area of concern, to include the surrounding inked resection margins, is submitted in blocks 2A through 2I.  The remaining specimen consists of soft yellow fat with a small amount of scattered fibrous tissue.  The remainder of the tissue, which is not situated at the area of concern, is submitted in blocks 2J through 2M.  The entire specimen has been submitted.  The specimen is sectioned and placed in cassettes in formalin at 10:10 hours on **DATE[Jan 27 12].   3:  Received in formalin labeled \"right breast lumpectomy margins\" are two unoriented fragments of yellow red fibrofatty breast tissue, obtained from the patient at 15:35 and placed in formalin at 15:40 on **DATE[Jan 26 12].  Fragments measure 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.5 cm and 4.0 x 2.5 x 1.9 cm.  One of the surfaces on each fragment is more convex and yellow and presumed to represent the outermost margin.  The surface on each fragment will be inked in blue.  The opposite side of each fragment is more roughened, flat, and hemorrhagic, presumed to represent the margin nearest to the previous excision.  This surface will be inked in yellow.  Each fragment is then serially sectioned and the cut surface consists of areas of firm, white fibrous tissue and soft and yellow adipose tissue.  No discrete suspicious nodule or mass is identified.  The entire smaller fragment is submitted in blocks 3A and 3B and the entire larger fragment submitted in blocks 3C through 3F.

Touch preps and obtained, and the specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section in one block.  The specimen is now resubmitted in toto for permanents in cassette BFSc. Part C is received in formalin additionally labeled \"left pelvic lymph node\".  The specimen consists of a 6 x 2 x 1 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated soft tissue, within which are four to five apparently separate pink-tan lymph nodes which range in size from 0.3 x 0.3 cm up to 4.5 x 1 cm.  Sections are submitted as follows: C1     four whole lymph nodes C2 and C3     one lymph node multisected. Part D is received in formalin additionally labeled \"right pelvic lymph node\".  The specimen consists of a 3 x 2.2 x 0.8 cm aggregate of yellow lobulated soft tissue, within which are two separate pink-tan lymph nodes which are 0.4 x 0.4 cm and 3 x 1 cm.  Sections are submitted as follows: D1     one whole lymph node D2     one lymph node multisected. Part E is received in formalin additionally labeled \"prostate tissue\". The specimen consists of a 53 gram, 4.8 x 4 x 3.5 cm prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles and segments of vas deferens.  The seminal vesicles are each approximately 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.8 cm.  The vas deferens segments are each 3 cm in length x 0.5 cm in diameter.  The surface of the prostate gland is smooth to roughened and intact with no defects.  The prostate is inked in the following manner:  right side = blue, left side = black, posterior overinked red.  Sectioning the prostate reveals two separate indurated yellowish lesions, one within the left posterior prostate and one within the right posterior prostate. The left posterior quadrant lesion is 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm and abuts the inked overlying capsule.  The right posterior quadrant lesion is 1.2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm and also abuts the inked overlying capsule.  Both lesions have a solid yellowish cut surface.  There is no gross evidence of extracapsular extension.  The seminal vesicles and vas deferens are grossly uninvolved.  The remainder of the prostate is notable for a moderate amount of periurethral nodularity throughout the entire specimen.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: E1     coned apex urethral margin E2 and E3     coned base urethral margin E4     right seminal vesicle, and vas deferens margin E5     left seminal vesicle, and vas deferens margin E6 through E11     right anterior prostate entirely submitted E12 through E17     right posterior prostate entirely submitted (right posterior quadrant lesion included in cassettes 15 through 17) E18 through E23     left anterior prostate entirely submitted E24 through E30     left posterior prostate entirely submitted (left posterior quadrant lesion included in cassettes 27 through 29). Please note, all sections of prostate are submitted in an apex-to-base (inferior-to-superior) manner. JAB:jg\nMicroscopic Description: A and B)  Review of the touch preparation, frozen, and permanent section control slides from the apex and bladder neck biopsies shows each to be benign with no tumor seen. C)  A total of five benign lymph nodes are retrieved on the left side, each free of tumor. D)   Two right side pelvic lymph nodes are retrieved, each free of tumor. E)   The coned apex prostatic urethral and bladder base urethral margins are each benign.  Sections of the right and left seminal vesicles show each to be benign, along with bilateral benign vas deferens shaved margins.  The right anterior prostate shows benign prostatic hyperplastic changes of glands and stroma with focal benign stromal nodules seen along with foci of chronic active prostatitis.  Focal transitional cell metaplastic change and reactive squamous metaplasia is noted within rare ducts.  No tumor is identified.  The right posterior prostate shows scattered foci of Gleason pattern 3 and focal Gleason pattern 4 prostatic adenocarcinoma, with the largest focus measuring up to 1.2 cm, demonstrating perineural invasion, and with a rare focus of extraprostatic extension into soft tissues in slide E17-1.  Infiltrating tumor extends to within 1 mm of the right posterior periprostatic soft tissue margin, with no direct margin involvement identified in this quadrant. Sections of the left anterior prostate show a rare less than 2 mm focus of Gleason pattern 3 adenocarcinoma appearing organ confined.  The left posterior prostate shows a few scattered foci of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), with additional foci of both Gleason pattern 3 and Gleason pattern 4 adenocarcinoma measuring up to 1.8 cm in greatest dimension (slide E27-1).  On the left side, the Gleason pattern 4 appears to slightly predominate.  No definitive extraprostatic extension is seen, with tumor within 1 mm again of the inked posterior periprostatic soft tissue resection margin. Tissue Code:  T1.

Right breast, superficial margin:  Focal ductal carcinoma in situ involving medial margin end of superficial margin reexcision./r/nDiagnosisComment:\nIntradepartmental consultation with Dr.  **NAME[ZZZ YYY] on **DATE[Mar 31 2012].  Findings reported to Dr. **NAME[XXX WWW] on **DATE[Mar 31 2012] at 2:20 PM with additional review of the prosection specimen pictures and correlation with operative orientation on **DATE[Apr 1 2012].  The margin that appears involved is best represented in block B8 of the medial end of the superficial margin re-excision.  This area of DCIS appears to involve a larger lactiferous duct with the level sections have apparent longitudinal spread of the DCIS to the inked margin aspect that could correlate to the usual pathway of the lactiferous duct drainage towards the nipple aspect.  Per discussion with Dr. **NAME[XXX WWW], this area corresponds to the subareolar breast tissue below the nipple.  Block A52 of the larger re-excision specimen also has focal DCIS close to the medial likely superficial margin aspect likely where these two specimen parts likely were nearly contiguous.  These findings suggest the superficial margin below the nipple is potentially at risk for DCIS extending beyond the additional re-excision tissue in likely a limited extent of a lactiferous duct as best that can be determined given the complicating factors of two specimen parts, orientation and margin inking factors./r/n\nGrossDescription:\nA.

DCIS and adjoining atypical ductal hyperplasia is seen in block A52 which appears focally close but is not actually seen at the margin in the medial more likely superficial margin end of the specimen.

Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and designated 'subcarinal lymph node #2' is a 1.8 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm pink-gray lymph node candidate which is frozen entirely.  Intraoperative frozen section diagnosis:  Lymph node negative for carcinoma (LDB).  The lymph node candidate is submitted entirely for permanent in cassette B1.  \nC.  Received fresh labeled with the patient's name and designated 'right upper lobe' is a 255 gram, 15 x 9 x 4 cm intact right upper lobectomy specimen with attached third and fourth ribs on the lateral surface of the lung which in total measure 5.5 x 5.2 x 2.9 cm.  The parenchymal, bronchial and vascular resection margins are all intact with staple lines.  The pleural surface is pink-purple and dull.  The ribs and surrounding soft tissue and muscle are focally adherent to the lung by a thin and delicate strand of fibrous tissue.  The third rib measures 3.8 cm in length x 1.1 cm in average diameter and the fourth rib measures 5.0 cm in length and ranges in diameter from 1.3 to 2.0 cm.  A firm palpable nodule is present on the pleural surface deep to the attached ribs.  The ribs and surrounding soft tissue are differentially inked to allow for the microscopic evaluation of the surgical resection margins as follows:  Medial bone resection margin   black, lateral bone resection margin   orange, and surrounding soft tissue resection margin   blue.  The bronchial resection margin, representative section of pericostal soft tissue and representative section of underlying mass are frozen in two blocks.  Intraoperative frozen section diagnoses: C1)Pericostal muscle: Negative for carcinoma; Subpleural mass: No residual carcinoma in representative section frozen. C2)Bronchial margin: Negative for carcinoma (LDB).  The staple lines at the lung resection margin are removed and the underlying parenchyma marked with blue ink.  Sectioning reveals a 3.0 x 2.1 x 0.7 cm tan-white firm subpleural nodule located at the previously mentioned palpable nodule deep to the attached ribs.  The nodule is located 7.0 cm from the bronchial resection margin and 5.5 cm from the blue inked parenchymal resection margin.  The remaining lung parenchyma is purple-red, slightly consolidated with no other discrete lesions or masses identified.  The ribs and surrounding soft tissue are placed in decal and will be gross and dictated later.  A single 0.5 cm in diameter pink-gray lymph node candidate is identified adjacent to the bronchus.  Sectioning through the ribs and soft tissue reveals unremarkable pink-red bony cut surface with surrounding tan-pink fibrous tissue and skeletal muscle.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:  C1   remaining frozen section of nodule and pericostal soft tissue resection margin, C2   remaining frozen section tissue of bronchial resection margin, C3   vascular resection margins, C4 through C6   subpleural nodule submitted entirely, C7   uninvolved lung parenchyma, C8   single lymph node candidate, C9 full thickness section through third rib, C10 perpendicular section through lateral end of third rib, C11 perpendicular section through medial end of third rib, C12 full-thickness section through fourth rib, C13 perpendicular sections through medial and lateral ends of fourth rib. \n \nD.  Received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and designated as 'fifth rib' is a 5.1 cm in length x 1.3 cm in average diameter portion of rib with attached 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.0 cm soft tissue on the anterior/superior aspect of the rib.  The rib is differentially inked to allow for the microscopic evaluation of surgical resection margins as follows:  Anterior surface of rib and soft tissue resection margin-blue, posterior surface of rib and soft tissue resection margin-green, medial end of rib-orange, and lateral end of rib-black.  Sectioning reveals tan-pink unremarkable soft tissue and skeletal muscle, with underlying unremarkable bone.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:  D1 and D2 full-thickness sections through fifth rib, D3 perpendicular sections through medial and lateral ends of rib.  \nE.  Received in formalin labeled with the patient's name and designated 'posterior margin' are two fragments of bone measuring 1.3 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm and 2.1 x 1.3 x 0.9 cm.  The fragments are entirely marked with blue ink and sectioned showing unremarkable bony cut surface with hemorrhagic marrow.  The fragments of bone are submitted entirely after decal with the bisected smaller fragment in E1 and larger fragment in E2 through E4.\n**INITIALS:ldk  **DATE[Apr 6 12]:**DATE[Apr 7 12]\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nA-B.  Sections are examined.  \nC.  The grossly described subpleural nodule is entirely submitted in blocks C5 through C6.  Rare residual tumor cells are identified in microscopic foci best seen in slides C4 and C5, which are further evaluated by broad spectrum cytokeratin immunohistochemical stains.  In C5, one of tumor foci is present within a medium-sized vessel. Tumor is also identified in the decalcified sections of the 3rd rib (slide C9) with evidence of tumor extending beyond the visceral pleura as seen on an elastic tissue stain. Viable tumor in block C9 is also confirmed by a cytokeratin immunohistochemical stain. It is difficult to determine if the viable tumor cells extend into the parietal pleura, as the tissue planes have been obliterated by fibrosis. Elastic tissue stains are also performed on tumor blocks C4, C5, and C6.\nD-E.  Sections are examined.  \n**INITIALS  **DATE[Apr 07 12]\n\n<INTRAOPERATIVE CONSULT>\nB.

JFJ/mbc\nGross Description Specimen 1 labeled left upper lobe with bronchial margins, received fresh for frozen section, consists of 286 gram lobectomy specimen that measures 18.0x10.2x4.0 cm. At a distance of approximately 8 mm from the bronchial margin is a tan tumor mass that measures 3.4x2.5x2.8 cm. The tumor extends to the pleural surface of this region but no extension through the pleura is seen. It also abuts some parabronchial nodes but no definite nodal involvement is identified. No additional masses are seen on sectioning through the lung. Sections are submitted as follows: frozen section resubmitted as A and B; arteriole margin with parabronchial nodes in C; sections of tumor in D-F; random section of lung away from mass in G.  Specimen 2 labeled lymph node 5, received in formalin, consists of an 8 mm gray lymph node with two additional tan fragments of tissue. The aggregate measurement is 1.5x1.5x0.8 cm. This is submitted in toto.  Specimen 3 labeled lymph node 9, received in formalin, consists of a single 6 mm gray nodule; submitted in toto.  Specimen 4 labeled lymph node 7, received in formalin, consists of a single 1 cm gray nodule; submitted in toto.  MHB/mbc\nMicroscopic Description Sections from the bronchial margin show benign respiratory epithelium which in focal areas show immature atypical squamous metaplasia as well as a focal area of high-grade dysplasia/carcinoma in situ composed of cells with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei and displaying mitotic activity. The process extends into adjacent peribronchial glands. Sections through the invasive tumor show a squamous cell carcinoma characterized as large groups of malignant cells with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei and background eosinophilic cytoplasm with keratinization. Angiolymphatic permeation by neoplasm is present. Perineural invasion by neoplasm is not identified. Sections through eight peribronchial lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma in two of eight. Sections through level 5 lymph node show anthracosis and sinus histiocytosis without evidence of metastatic carcinoma. Sections from level 9 lymph node show similar findings without evidence of metastatic carcinoma. Sections from level 7 lymph node show similar findings without evidence of metastatic carcinoma.

Similarly, only rare CD19 positive B cells are\npresent, accounting for less than 0.1% of total events. Since bone marrow\ninvolvement by lymphoma is generally a focal process, sampling issues must\nbe considered when negative results are obtained. Both paratrabecular and\nfibrotic infiltrates are typically not well represented in aspirate\nspecimens and usually require evaluation of the biopsy core for detections.\nTherefore, clinical and morphologic correlation is required for complete\ninterpretation.\n\nMORPHOLOGY:\nThe cytospin preparation demonstrates a predominance of neutrophils with\noccasional myeloid precursors, consistent with hemodilution. Intermixed are\nmature lymphocytes, eosinophils, and monocytes. An increase in blasts is\nnot appreciated.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nViability:  97%\nThe following antigens were examined: CD5  CD19  CD33  CD34  CD45  kappa\nlambda\n\nBlasts:\nOnly scant CD34 positive blasts are present (see above comment).\n\nLymphoid population:\nOnly rare CD19 positive events are identified (see above comment). As only\n6 B cells were identified (out of a total of 24,465 total cell events),\nthere are insufficient cells to accurately determine kappa:lambda ratio.\nThere is no demonstrable coexpression of CD5 on these cells.\n\nApproximately 27% of total events are CD5+ T-cells.\n\nMyeloid/monocyte populations:\nThe majority of recorded events are CD33 positive granulocytes.\n\nMonocytes identified by forward and side scatter characteristics, in\nconjunction with CD33 expression, comprise 9% of total events.\n\nIf images are listed within this report, they can be viewed by authorized\nusers on **WEB-LOC, Pathology Express.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.\nThis laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement\nAmendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical\ntesting.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies (if performed) with the\nmedical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[ZZZ M YYY]\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Mar 03 2012] 05:16 PM\nSPECIMEN:\n\n\nReferral ID #:\n# Unstained Slides:\n# Stained Slides:\n# Blocks:\nSpecimen Type:      Bone Marrow\n\n\n\n\n\n\nB: CD34\nB: Kappa vs Lambda\nB: CD3 vs CD19\n"

Receptor studies pending and results will follow as an addendum.\nGrossDescription:\n  Received in formalin labeled right breast 9 o?clock are three tan, yellow, cylindrical, fibrofatty tissues, which range from 1.3cm to 1.8cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto as 1A.\n\n  Fixation of specimen reviewed and assured to be 6 to 48 hours. \nMD:lefb **DATE[Apr 19 2013].\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  Slides reviewed.\n1: Right breast core biopsy\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nER/PR HERCEPTEST (QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION)\n      \nEstrogen and Progesterone Receptor analysis and the Herceptest (DAKO) for HER2 protein overexpression are performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block 1A) using immunohistochemical techniques.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TECHNICAL INFORMATION: \nDeparaffinized sections of tissue are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies, along with appropriate positive controls. Localization is via a biotin-free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody. The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.\n\nSUMMATION OF FINDINGS: \n\nThe Estrogen Receptor (VECTOR-CLONE 6F11) is positive in 99% of the tumor cells showing 3+ staining intensity. The Progesterone Receptor (DAKO-Clone PgR 636) is positive in 20% of the tumor cells showing 2 to 3+ staining intensity. The Herceptest (DAKO) shows 3+ positive staining, after evaluation of membrane staining intensity and pattern on the standardized  0-3+ scale. Limited sample; consider repeat Herceptest on final surgical specimen. Seen at pathology conference.\n\nNOTE: Positive Estrogen Receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells. Positive Progesterone receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.\n\nImmunohistochemical estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor test results are reported using the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria. If positive, staining intensity may be reported numerically 1, 2, 3+ or descriptively as weak, moderate or strong. \n\nNOTE: ASCO/CAP scoring criteria for HER2 protein over-expression by immunohistochemistry are as stated: Positive cases show strong and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive cancer cells (score 3). Negative cases are defined as those with no staining (score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (score 1). Equivocal or indeterminate cases show strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells or less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nPQRS CODE: 3394F.\n"

The tumor cells are e-cadherin negative supporting the diagnosis of lobular carcinoma.  Over 90% of tumor nuclei demonstrate strong positive ER receptor staining.  Approximately 65% of tumor nuclei demonstrate strong progesterone receptor staining. This service has been rendered in part by a resident.  A pathologist has personally reviewed the slides/tissue and has rendered and is responsible for the diagnosis that appears on the report. The primary antibody clone used for estrogen receptor analysis is Neomarker clone SP1 and Dako PgR636 for progesterone receptor analysis.  The detection system for both is Dakocytoenvision (+) R System HRP (DAB).  Only nuclear staining is counted and any value +/> 1% tumor cell nuclear staining is considered a positive test. The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.

The\nmonoclonal plasma cells comprise 6% of total events.  As the number of\nplasma cells is often underestimated by flow cytometric analysis, plasma\ncell enumeration is best performed by morphologic evaluation. The\nsignificance of the monoclonal plasma cell population (i.e. MGUS versus\nmyeloma) requires correlation with clinical, morphologic, laboratory (i.e.\nSPEP, UPEP), and radiographic findings.\n\nNo evidence of a phenotypically abnormal B-cell or T-cell population is\nidentified with the antibodies examined.  Since bone marrow involvement by\nlymphoma is generally a focal process, sampling issues must be considered\nwhen negative results are obtained. Both paratrabecular and fibrotic\ninfiltrates are typically not well represented in aspirate specimens and\nwill usually require morphologic evaluation of the biopsy core for\ndetection.\n\nThe CD34 positive blasts account for 0.1% of total events. Although the\nCD34 positive blast percentage is not significantly increased, this does\nnot exclude the possibility of a myelodysplastic or myeloproliferative\ndisorder. In addition, blasts do not always express CD34 antigen.\nCorrelation with clinical and morphologic findings is therefore recommended\nfor diagnostic interpretation and overall blast enumeration.\n\nThe results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Aug 30 2012].\n\nMORPHOLOGY:\nThe cytospin preparation shows a population of plasma cells, some of which\nare intermediate in size, admixed with maturing myeloid elements and small\nlymphocytes.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nViability:  93%\nThe following antigens were examined: CD3  CD4  CD8  CD10  CD19  CD20  CD33\nCD34  CD38  CD45  CD56  CD138  cKappa  cLambda  kappa  lambda\n\nBlasts:\nCD34 positive blasts comprise 0.1% of total events.\n\nLymphoid population:\nPolytypic B-cells account for 2% of total events and have a normal\nkappa:lambda light chain ratio of 1.5:1.\n\nApproximately 25% of total events are mature T-cells with a normal CD4:CD8\nratio of 1.3:1 and normal pan T-cell antigen expression with the antibodies\nexamined.\n\nPlasma cell population:\nMonoclonal plasma cell population identified, see comment above.\n\nMyeloid/monocyte populations:\n39% of recorded events are CD33 positive maturing myeloid cells.\n\nMonocytes identified by forward and side scatter characteristics, in\nconjunction with CD4 and CD33 coexpression, comprise 6% of total events.\n\nIf images are listed within this report, they can be viewed by authorized\nusers on **WEB-LOC, Pathology Express.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.

Submitted in two cassettes.\n\n\n<COMMENT>\nSections show fragments of breast tissue with discreet lesion corresponding to a benign hyalinized fibroadenoma present. This likely corresponds to the radiographically described small mass lesion. However, foci of atypical lobular hyperplasia (lobular neoplasia) are present and confirmed with immunohistochemical studies for E-cadherin (see immunohistochemistry). While no evidence of atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma-in-situ, or invasive malignancy is present, lobular neoplasia can, in some instances, be a clinical indication for additional sampling if deemed clinically and radiographically necessary.\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\n\n\n<FINAL DX>\n BREAST, LEFT, \"2 O'CLOCK\", ENCOR BIOPSY:  FOCAL ATYPICAL LOBULAR HYPERPLASIA.

Loss of protein expression for any of the mismatch repair genes helps to identify the causative gene and makes further mutation testing more efficient, if indicated following genetic counseling.  Immunohistochemical results are not definitive evidence of a germline versus a tumor-acquired alteration.\nResultsComments:\nLoss of PMS2 protein expression is noted in the carcinoma and adenoma without evidence of MLH1 loss; however, since MLH1 is much more frequently implicated than PMS2 in DNA mismatch repair defects, a primary deficiency of MLH1 is still a strong consideration.  Correlation with additional molecular genetic testing, particularly PMS2 gene mutation analysis, may be helpful and further evaluation by a genetics counselor at the **INSTITUTION (phone: **PHONE) is highly recommended.\n\nReference:  de Jong AE et al.

The serosal surface is smooth and tan-pink. The proximal margin is a length of ileum measuring 2.0 cm in length x 2.0 cm average outside diameter.  Opening reveals a grossly normal tan-pink mucosa with no grossly identifiable masses or lesions.  Representative sections are submitted in blocks 1-9.  Section summary: block 1 proximal margin, block 2 distal margin, block 3 random sections of intestine, blocks 4-6 appendiceal orifice and stump, blocks 7-9 lymph node.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nProximal and distal margins of resection are unremarkable.  Sections of the appendiceal stump area exhibit foci of high-grade intraepithelial dysplasia, but no residual invasive carcinoma.  There are foci of adjacent mixed acute and chronic inflammation and reactive fibrosis, consistent with recent appendectomy.  There is a small simple mesothelial cyst present.

Labeled with patient\nname **NAME[AAA BBB] and MRN **ID-NUM.\nA.   Container designation: \"transverse and descending colon, prior ileal\ntransverse anastomosis\"   Received unfixed is a 49 cm long hemicolectomy\nspecimen with an external diameter that ranges between 5 and 7 cm.  The\nproximal and distal ends are stapled and measure 3 and 4 cm respectively\nwhich are shaved and placed en face with the distal margin inked green.\nThe external surface is remarkable for an area of puckering 15 cm from the\nclosest distal margin which is inked black, the remainder of the surface is\ntan-pink with an area of adhesion surrounding the proximal end and includes\na moderate amount of pericolonic adipose tissue. The specimen is opened\nlongitudinally to reveal a site of anastomosis on the proximal end that is\nintact and free of any hemorrhage. The portion of ileum measures 3 cm in\nlength and 1.5 cm in diameter.  The mucosa shows a normal folded pattern\nthat is tan, pink and edematous on the proximal portion.  The specimen is\nremarkable for a circumferential mass that occludes the lumen that has\nulcerated and heaped up borders located 12.5 cm from the distal margin, 20\ncm from the proximal margin. The tumor itself measures 8.5 x 2.5 cm and\ngrossly invades the muscularis with possible involvement of the surrounding\nadipose tissue.  Palpation reveals a total of thirteen possible lymph\nnodes, the largest measures 2 x 1.5 x 1 cm located adjacent to the area of\npuckering.\nCassette summary:\nA1   proximal margin en face;\nA2   distal margin en face;\nA3   proximal to anastomosis;\nA4   distal to anastomosis;\nA5-A9   representative of tumor;\nA10   possible site of adipose invasion;\nA11   tumor;\nA12   uninvolved edematous mucosa proximal to tumor;\nA13   uninvolved mucosa distal to tumor;\nA14   one node serially sectioned;\nA15   one node bisected;\nA16   one node bisected;\nA17   one node bisected;\nA18   one node bisected;\nA19   one node;\nA20   three nodes;\nA21   one node bisected;\nA22   additional firm adipose tissue to be screened for lymph nodes and\ntumor invasion.\n\n(Dictated by: **PLACE, PA) (Resident:  **NAME[YYY XXX], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[WWW VVV] UUU] PhD\n\nElectronically signed **DATE[Feb 27 2012] 11:08 AM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

DGD/mbc\nGross Description Specimen 1 received fresh for frozen section labeled right upper lobe wedge consists of a 25.4 gram, 11.0x4.0x4.0 cm tan/purple lung wedge biopsy. Sectioning reveals a 1.8x1.8x1.5 cm ill defined tan firm nodule, 1.7 cm from the closest stapled resection margin. The nodule is at the periphery of the wedge and grossly involves the pleura. The remaining lung parenchyma is dark purple and spongy. No other masses are appreciated. A representative section of the mass is submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: 1A - frozen section residue; 1B - stapled resection margin taken en face; 1C-1E - additional representative sections of mass. Specimen 2 received in formalin labeled L7 lymph node consists of a 1.5 cm in greatest dimension black anthracotic lymph node which is submitted in toto in cassette 2. Specimen 3 received in formalin labeled L4 lymph node consists of a few pieces of black anthracotic soft tissue aggregating 0.4 cm in greatest dimension which are submitted in toto in cassette 3. Specimen 4 received in formalin labeled right upper lobe consists of a 127.7 gram, 12.0x8.0x5.0 cm intact lobectomy specimen. There is a 7 cm in length staple line identified consistent with the previous wedge biopsy site. The staple line is 3.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin. No invasive tumor is identified along the staple line. Sectioning reveals dark red congested slightly firm lung parenchyma. No suspicious nodules or invasive tumor is identified. A few lymph nodes are identified around the hilum. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: 4A - bronchial resection margin taken en face; 4B - vascular resection margin taken en face; 4C-4D - staple line; 4E - hilar lymph node. HM/mbc\nMicroscopic Description Sections of the wedge biopsy show a very poorly differentiated non-small cell neoplasm that is highly necrotic with sparing of viable tumor cells predominantly seen only around small blood vessels. The tumor has a high degree of nuclear pleomorphism, prominent macronucleoli and there is a hint of pigmentation in some of the cytoplasm within the tumor. Immunohistochemistry for P63, CK5/6, TTF, Napsin, and melanin A mart 1 are pending.  Sections of the node show extensive sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis with no evidence of metastatic tumor identified. There is a small granuloma in the adjacent perilymph nodal adipose. Sections of the entirely submitted lymph nodal tissue show sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis without evidence of metastatic tumor. Sections of the bronchial and vascular margins of the right upper lobe resection show no evidence of tumor. The lung lobe from which the prior wedge excision was made is also free of tumor, however, it shows acute intraalveolar hemorrhage and some old focal areas of organizing pneumonitis with scattered foreign body giant cell which are associated with what appears to be vegetable matter consistent with aspiration materials. A total of three hilar nodes are seen and these show sinus histiocytosis and anthracosis with a number of small noncaseating granulomas some of which are hyalinized. DGD/mbc ADDITIONAL MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Immunohistochemistry for pankeratin is strongly positive in the tumor cells. There is weak p63 immunostaining and negative MART-1, TTF1, Napsin, and CK5/6. The tumor is compatible with a poorly differentiated carcinoma. **INITIALS\nAmendments: Amended:  **DATE[Jun 20 2012] by **NAME[ZZZ YYY] Reason: Immunohistochemical Results      Previous Signout Date:  **DATE[Jun 19 2012] Electronically Signed Out By DARON **PLACE Procedures/Addenda\n"

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA compatible \n                  With colorectal primary (see comment)\n              2. Tumor size: 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm\n              3. Resection margin free of tumor (0.3 cm clearance)\n\nB.  Liver, proximal margin, biopsy:      Benign fibrous, vascular, and neural tissue\n\nC.  Liver, right partial hepatectomy:      1. METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA compatible \n                  With colorectal primary (see comment)\n              2. Tumor size: 1.8 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm\n              3. Resection margin free of tumor (0.3 cm clearance)\n\nD.  Gallbladder and contents, cholecystectomy:  1. Chronic cholecystitis and mucosa denudation\n              2. No tumor seen.\nDiagnosisComment:\nThe tumor cells in parts A and C are morphologically identical.  Immunohistochemical stains performed on part A show that the tumor cells are positive for CK20 and CDX-2 while negative for CK7.  The morphology and immunoprofile is compatible with a metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma.  Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] concurs with the diagnoses.\nGrossDescription:\nA.  Received fresh for intraoperative frozen section labeled \"XXXXXX, segment #4 liver mass\" is soft tan tissue, 5.4 x 2.2 x 2.1 cm.  The surgical margin is inked green.  Sectioning reveals a firm, white to tan nodule, up to 2.2 x 1.7 x .0 cm, 0.4 cm from the nearest inked margin.  Representative sections are submitted in 7 cassettes as follows:  A1 as frozen section, A2-A5 nodule, submitted entirely, serially, A6-A7 representative of remainder of the specimen.\n\nB.  Received fresh for intraoperative frozen section labeled \"XXXXXX, proximal margin\" is soft tan tissue, 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.3 cm.  Submitted entirely in one cassette after frozen section, with B as frozen section.\n\nC.  Received fresh for intraoperative frozen section labeled \"XXXXXX, partial right hepatectomy margins\" is soft tan tissue, 6.5 x 4.8 x 2.9 cm.  The surgical margin is inked black.  Sectioning reveals a firm, white to tan nodule, up to 1.8 x 1.6 x 1.5 cm, 0.4 cm from the nearest inked margin.  Representative sections are submitted in 7 cassettes after gross examination as follows:  C1-C6 nodule, C7 representative sections from the remainder of the specimen.\n\nD.  Received in formalin labeled \"XXXXXX, gallbladder and contents is an unopened, unoriented tan gallbladder, 7.6 cm in length x 3.1 cm in diameter.  The serosa is tan, smooth.  The wall measures 0.3 cm in thickness and is slightly edematous.  The mucosa is velvety, gold to light yellow.  No stones are grossly identified.   There is 30 cc of viscous dark green to brown sludge.  Representative sections are submitted in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA-D.   The microscopic findings support the above diagnoses.\nA: Segment #4 - liver mass\nB: Proximal margin - liver\nC: Partial right hepatectomy margins for FS\nD: Gallbladder and contents\n"

This pattern argues against transitional carcinoma. A second panel of immunohistochemical stains including cytokeratin, inhibin, calretinin, ER, and P53 are performed to confirm a diagnosis of carcinoma and to exclude a sex cord-stromal tumor. The tumor is negative for inhibin and calretinin and is strongly positive for ER, cytokeratin and P53. While the tumor does not have the morphology of a typical serous tumor, some of the foci show nuclear clearing, particularly in the diaphragmatic and liver capsule metastases. However, P53 positivity is rare in clear cell and endometriod ovarian tumors. The findings are most consistent with an undifferentiated carcinoma. Since a large portion of the tumor is seen within the right ovary, it will be staged as an ovarian primary although the ipsilateral fallopian tube also shows considerable tumor. This case was shown in Consensus Conference. The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.

Sectioned through the short axis and totally frozen in two blocks with controls submitted as FSC1A and 1B. 2: Received fresh for frozen section evaluation labeled  \"right sentinel node biopsy\" is a 1.4 x 1.0 x 0.6 cm nodule consistent with lymph node.  Sectioned and totally frozen in one block with control submitted as FSC2A. 3: Received in formalin designated \"left breast\" is an unoriented 559 gm 21.0 x 16.0 x 5.5 cm left breast which is obtained from the patient at 1614 and placed in formalin at 1616 on **DATE[Feb 29 12].  The specimen is sectioned into cassettes and placed in formalin at 1100 on **DATE[Feb 30 12]. Attached anteriorly to the specimen is a 16.5 x 7.5 cm tan pink skin ellipse with a central soft slightly invaginated 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.5 cm nipple.  The deep margin is inked in blue.  On serially sectioned the deep margin perpendicular to the inked surface there is marked fibrocystic disease scattered throughout the entire specimen with dense fibrous tissue which is focally nodular scattered throughout all four breast quadrants.  There are multiple cysts filled with cloudy watery red brown fluid which measure up to 0.8 cm in diameter.  Two areas within the fibrous tissue are somewhat more indurated.  Each of these areas are noted in what appears to be upper outer quadrant tissue and area approximately 1.0 cm away from the deep margin.  The first area measures 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4 cm and it abuts the second and larger area measuring 1.0 cm.  This may represent a single lesion.  This lesion is located beneath skin.  Sections are submitted as follows: 3A and 3B  perpendicular sections of the deep margin from the four breast quadrants. 3C  smaller area of concern noted in the upper outer quadrant breast tissue 3D  perpendicular section of the deep margin nearest to this area  3E  sections of the adjacent larger area of concern noted  3F  perpendicular sections of the deep margin nearest to this area 3G  nodular and fibrous tissue upper outer quadrant 3H  lower outer quadrant 3I  - upper inner quadrant  3J  lower inner quadrant 3K  section of nipple 3L  additional section of skin On sectioning around the periphery of the specimen, no nodes are grossly identified.  Also within the container is an additional 3 cm aggregate of fatty tissue fragments measuring up to 2.5 cm in greatest dimension.  The largest fragment has an attached 2 cm portion of tan skin.  No gross lesions are noted within these fragments and sections are submitted in block 3M. 4: Received in formalin designated \"right breast\", specimen obtained at 1644, placed in formalin at 1645 on **DATE[Feb 29 12].  The specimen is sectioned and placed in blocks in formalin at 1130 on **DATE[Feb 30 12].  It is a 632 gm unoriented 20.0 x 18.0 x 7.5 cm right breast which includes an overlying 18.5 x 9.0cm flap of tan pink skin which has a central soft and somewhat invaginated 0.7 x 0.5 x0 .5 cm nipple. Located 4.5 cm from the nipple is a 3.0 cm partially healed biopsy incision.  In addition the skin surrounding the nipple is stained with blue dye.  Prior to sectioning the deep margin is inked in blue.  On sectioning partially opened through the deep margin is a 6.0 x 6.0 x 5.5 cm biopsy cavity situated within less than 1 mm of the  deep margin.  The walls of the biopsy cavity are tan brown and extremely fibrous.  The cavity wall is also within 0.5 cm of the nearest anterior soft tissue margin immediately adjacent to the edge of the skin.  The anterior margin at this point will be inked in green.  On serially sectioning through the biopsy cavity wall the cut surface is extremely dense with a few scattered areas of hemorrhage.  There are no discrete nodules or masses noted.  The cut surface is diffusely indurated.  There are occasional small cysts measuring up to 0.5 cm.  ON sectioning through the breast tissue away from the biopsy cavity the cut surface consists of soft pink white fibrous tissue with no discrete nodules or masses.  Sections are submitted as follows: 4A  through 4D  perpendicular sections of the deep margin nearest to the biopsy cavity 4E  and 4F  perpendicular sections of the anterior inked margin nearest to the biopsy cavity 4G through 4K  representative sections around the biopsy cavity wall extending into the adjacent breast tissue 4L  through 4O  additional representative sections of breast tissue away from the biopsy cavity from the four breast quadrants 4P  section of nipple 4Q  additional sections of skin On sectioning around the edge of the specimen, no lymph nodes are identified.

COMMENT:  The pathologic stage is based upon the AJCC cancer staging manual seventh edition guidelines.  PATHOLOGIST's COMMENTS  The appendix tumor displays features of goblet cell carcinoid, additionally there are features of frank adenocarcinoma (i.e. linear single-file growth, a mucin lake containing fused glands and a rare focus of infiltrating glands resembling typical colorectal adenocarcinoma).   Using appropriate positive and negative controls, sections from the appendix are submitted for immunoreactive cytokeratin (AE1/3), synaptophysin, chromogranin, CD56 and cytokeratin 20 via an immunohistochemical technique.  Tumor cells stain moderate to strongly and diffusely positive for cytokeratin (AE1/3), synaptophysin, CD56 and cytokeratin 20.  Tumor cells are negative for chromogranin.  All internal and external controls react appropriately.  INTERPRETATION:  This staining pattern supports neuroendocrine differentiation for this tumor.  Note:  The specimen is re-examined, no additional lymph nodes are identified.  Reviewed for QA (LK).  Case discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Nov 08 12] at approximately 11:00 a.m. \nGROSS DESCRIPTION  Received in formalin designated \"ileum, appendix and cecum\" is a segment of ileum with attached adhesed appendix and cecum.  The specimen is received closed at both ends by a line of surgical staples.  The serosal surface of the specimen is covered by fibrinous hemorrhagic adhesion.  The terminal ileum measures 8.5 cm in length and up to 5.5 cm in diameter.  The attached colon segment measures 6.5 cm in length and up to 9.0 cm in circumference.  The specimen is opened longitudinally to reveal unremarkable mucosal folding throughout the terminal ileum and colon.  The ileocecal valve is unremarkable and patent. There are no polyps or masses identified.  The mucosal surface at the level of the appendiceal orifice is slightly erythematous in appearance.  The adhesed appendix measures 9.0 cm in length and up to 1.8 cm in diameter.  The serosal surface associated with the appendix is marked with black ink.  Sectioning the appendix reveals a dilated lumen filled with clear mucoid fluid.  Sectioning of the surrounding attached limited adipose tissue reveals a single possible lymph node candidate measuring 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.  Please note:  95-100% of the appendix is submitted for microscopic examination.

The polypoid mass does not appear to involve the underlying lamina propria.  The polypoid mass encompasses >75% of the lumen.  \n\nThere is an area of narrowing of the lumen, starting 7.6 cm from the proximal margin, and ending at the polypoid mass described above.  This area of decreased lumen coincides with an area of adhesion of the mesentery on the serosal surface.  The mesentery encompasses the entire circumference of the bowel at the area of narrowing.  The mesentery surrounding the segment of bowel is grossly unremarkable, with no masses.  \n\nMultiple possible lymph nodes are identified, largest up to 0.4 cm.  \n\nRepresentative sections are submitted in 26 cassettes, as follows:\n\nKEY TO CASSETTES:\n1  -  Proximal (blue)\n2  -  Distal (orange) \n3-10  -  Tan polypoid mass described above en block (serosal surface inked black)\n11  -  Uninvolved mucosa \n12  -  Representative of mesentery that is adherent/surrounds the bowel at the area of narrowing \n13-26  -  Possible lymph nodes and surrounding adipose tissue.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the above diagnosis.\nA: Transverse colon splenic flexure, suture marks distal margin\n"

Because both the HER2 and CEP17 signals were significantly\nelevated in this case, we assessed this tumor for alternative chromosome 17\nloci (SMS, RARA, and P53 genes) in order to determine if evaluation of the\ncopy number for these alternative chromosome 17 loci, could lead to a\nsignificantly increased HER2:Chromosome 17 ratio. The results for these\nadditional FISH studies demonstrated that these loci were elevated to a\nsimilar degree as the CEP17 copy number. Therefore, the HER2:chromosome 17\nratio is not elevated and this case should be considered NEGATIVE for HER2\namplification.\nMATERIAL RECEIVED\nA1 = ***PATH-NUMBER[1], A1, 1 Block (**DATE[Apr 07 2012])\nFixative: Formalin\nDuration of fixation >6 and <48 hours?: YES\nCLIENT REQUEST/CLINICAL HISTORY\nHER2 FISH.\nMETHODOLOGY\nHER2 FISH testing is performed according to ASCO-CAP guidelines (Wolff AC et\nal., J Clin Oncol 25:**PHONE). FISH testing for the purpose of alternative\nchromosome 17 enumeration using probes to the SMS, RARA, and P53 loci has been\nindependently validated. Methods: Deparaffinized sections of tissue,\nfollowing pretreatment, are incubated with PathVysion    HER2 probe kit (**NAME[ZZZ]\n**PLACE, IL) containing 2 separate probes: a locus-specific HER2\ngene probe (17p11.2-q12 ) and a reference chromosome 17 centromere probe\n(CEP17; 17p11.1-q11.1). Separate, similarly treated tissue section slides are\nincubated with an **PLACE, IL) and a P53 (**PLACE, IL) probe, the later also containing a CEP17 probe.\nMorphometric image analysis is performed using a MetaSystems    platform and\nMetafer 4    application software. The HER2 and CEP17 signals are counted per\ntile/nucleus and the HER2:CEP17 ratio is calculated. Similarly, the SMS/**NAME[CCC]\nand P53 signals are also enumerated per nucleus. FISH Scoring: \nResults are scored as positive, negative, or equivocal for amplification based on\nevaluation of the signal copy numbers for the alternative chromosome 17 loci.\nTest Validation: The test methodology for HER2/CEP17 FISH testing employed in\nthis laboratory has demonstrated an extremely high concordance rate between\nIHC and FISH (Gown AM et al., Mod Pathol **ID-NUM, 2008; Yaziji H et al.,\nJAMA **ID-NUM, 2004). In the most recent study of 6604 patients, a 99.2%\nconcordance was demonstrated between negative (0 or 1+) HER2 IHC and\nnon-amplified HER2 FISH, and a 94.7% concordance was demonstrated between\npositive (3+) HER2 IHC and amplified HER2 FISH. Quality Assurance: PhenoPath\nLaboratories has in place a quality assurance program for HER2 FISH, which\nincludes daily controls (cell lines and tissues), Levy-Jennings analysis of\nHER2 controls, and ongoing concordance studies between IHC and FISH, to ensure\nhigh levels of interobserver and methodology concordance. . *PhenoPath\nLaboratories' HER2 validation and ongoing monitoring of IHC and FISH assays\ndemonstrate extremely high concordance (>95%) that is independent of the\nreported duration of fixation.\nChief Pathologist\nPer CMS regulations, the pathologist's signature above indicates that this\ncase has been reviewed and the diagnosis made or confirmed by said\npathologist.\nNote: Some of the tests reported here may have been developed and performance\ncharacteristics determined by PhenoPath Laboratories. They have not been\ncleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). However,\nthe FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\nPursuant to the requirements of CLIA, this laboratory has established and\nverified the accuracy and precision of all tests, and additional information\nabout these tests is available upon request. PhenoPath Laboratories is\ncertified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)\nas qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.\n\n"

No residual invasive ductal carcinoma is seen within the wall of the biopsy cavity.  The staging information is based on the original biopsy (***PATH-NUMBER[1]).\n\nSpecimen signed out at **STREET-ADDRESS, **ROOM, **PLACE, HI   **ZIP-CODE.\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"XXXXXX, left breast\" is a breast with attached axillary tissue, measuring up to 26.0 x 16.0 x 3.8 cm.  The axillary contents measure up to 8.5 x 7.5 x 3.3 cm.  The overlying, attached segment of skin measures up to 13.0 cm in length and 7.5 cm in width.  The nipple and areola measure 1.2 and 2.2 cm in diameter, respectively, and are unremarkable.  Present approximately 1.5 cm superior to the nipple, and extending along the upper outer and upper inner quadrant is a sutured, roughly linear incision measuring up to 4.5 cm in length.  The specimen is inked as follows: superior anterior - orange, inferior anterior - blue, posterior (deep) - black.  Deep to the incision, sectioning reveals a biopsy cavity that measures up to 5.7 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm.  The biopsy cavity is located approximately 1.0 cm from the skin surface and extends to within 0.3 cm of the posterior (deep) margin and measures up to 5.7 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm.  A biopsy cavity is lined by slightly firm, tan to pink-tan tissue.  No definite residual tissue is grossly identified.  Elsewhere, sections through the remainder of the breast reveals lobulated fatty tissue, and scant amounts of rubbery breast parenchyma.  The axillary tissue is arbitrarily divided into thirds, designated as \"lower, mid, and upper\".  Embedded within the soft tissue are multiple non-matted lymph nodes, ranging from a few millimeters up to 2.0 cm.  The cut surfaces are pink-gray to gray-white, rubbery to slightly firm.  The specimen is placed in formalin on **DATE[Mar 28 12] at 12:30pm for a total fixation time of approximately 6.5 hours.  Cold ischemic time information was not provided.  Representative sections and all identified lymph nodes are submitted.\n\nKEY TO CASSETTES:\n1  -  Nipple and areola\n2  -  Sutured incision along skin\n3-7  -  Biopsy cavity, including posterior (deep) margin\n8  -  Upper outer quadrant\n9  -  Upper inner quadrant \n10  -  Lower outer quadrant \n11  -  Lower inner quadrant \n12  -  2 possible \"lower third\" axillary lymph nodes\n13  -  1 possible \"low\" axillary lymph node (representative section)\n14  -  1 possible \"low\" axillary lymph node, bisected \n15  -  3 possible \"middle third\" lymph nodes\n16  -  1 possible \"middle third\" lymph node, bisected\n17  -  1 possible \"middle third\" axillary lymph node (representative section)\n18  -  2 possible \"upper third\" axillary lymph node.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the above diagnosis.\nA: Left breast\n"

The cut surface is pink and smooth, focally replaced by adipose tissue.  No blue dye is identified.  Touch Preps are performed.  (See Touch Prep Diagnosis #1).  The lymph node is bisected and entirely submitted as 1A.\n\n  Container 2:  Received fresh labeled sentinel lymph node level 1 400CPS is a 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.6cm pink lymph node with a minimal amount of adherent yellow adipose tissue.  The cut surface is pink to red and smooth.  Touch Preps are performed.  (See Touch Prep Diagnosis #2).  The lymph node is trisected and entirely submitted as 2A.\n\n  Container 3:  Received fresh labeled cancer left breast needle local is a fibrofatty portion of breast tissue oriented by marker clips measuring 5.5cm from cranial to caudal, 5.5cm from medial to lateral and 2.8cm from anterior to posterior.  There is a needle localization wire extending out of the anterior aspect of the specimen.  The specimen radiograph localizes a soft tissue density without associated microcalcifications and an adjacent mammotome clip.  The margins are marked with silver nitrate prior to sectioning and additionally inked as follows:  cranial blue, caudal green, lateral yellow, anterior orange, posterior black.  Sectioning reveals a 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.0cm white, firm, gritty mass, corresponding to the soft tissue density localized on the radiograph.  The mass is identified 0.3cm from the nearest margin (anterior), 0.6cm from the cranial margin, 1.5cm from the caudal margin and greater than 1.8cm from the remaining margins.  There is a mammotome clip embedded within the mass, consistent with a previous site of biopsy.  The remaining breast parenchyma consists of a moderate amount of dense, white, cystic, fibrous tissue, admixed with yellow, lobular, glistening, adipose tissue.  The fibrous tissue represents approximately 80% of the parenchyma.  The identified cysts measure up to 0.2cm in diameter and contains light brown fluid.  No additional lesions are identified.  The breast tissue is reradiographed and representative sequential sections are submitted from lateral to medial as follows:  3A, lateral margin; 3B through 3E, entire mass to include the anterior margin (mammotome clip localized in cassette 3D); 3F, posterior margin; 3G, cranial margin; 3H, caudal margin; 3I, medial margin.  All margins are represented.\n\n  Fixation of specimen reviewed and assured to be 6 to 48 hours. \nCH:lefb **DATE[Nov 4 2012].\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  Slides reviewed.\n1: Left sentinal lymph node(s)2: Left sentinal lymph node(s)3: NL- Left breast biopsy requiring evaluation of surgical  margins\n"

The lymph node section and a scrape prep is obtained for a\nmicroscopic evaluation and the lymph node is entirely submitted in A1-A2.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CYTOLOGY -  RIGHT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE: POSITIVE FOR\nCARCINOMA ON SCRAPE PREPARATION (XX)\nB.   Container designation: \"right breast and axilla\" --  The specimen\nconsists of a 27.1 x 20.5 x 8.0 cm right breast with attached axillary\ntail, which is oriented as per requisition slip as follow:  \"suture\nlateral\".  Breast is surface by diffusely erythematous 24.3 x 13.3 cm\nellipse of skin with focally erythematous nipple and unremarkable areola.\nLateral to the nipple (1.7 cm) there is a 1.8 x 0.3 cm red somewhat firm\narea possibly incision site.  The axillary tail measures 8.5 x 7.5 x 3.0 cm\nand is amputated from the breast.  The margins are inked as follows:\nAmputated axillary tail site   blue; superior anterior   red;\ninferior/anterior   green and deep   black.  The weight of the mastectomy\nis 2300 gms. There is a 2.5 x 2.0 x 1.8 cm partially cavitated previous\nbiopsy site.  The biopsy cavity site comes within 4.8 cm of the deep\nmargin.  The cut surfaces are comprised of 80% adipose tissue and 20%\nfibrous breast stroma.  Axillary lymph nodes range from 0.2 to 3.5 cm.\nSeveral lymph nodes are grossly positive and several lymph nodes are matted\ntogether.

The MOC-31and BER-EP4 along with  the CK5 and p63 stains are positive.  TTF-1, CK7, CK20, CDX2, Glypican, HepPar-1, CD 10 and CA19-9 are negative.  This pattern is suggestive of mixed squamous cell-adenocarcinoma of lung origin.\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in fixative labeled \"XXXXXX, XXXXXX\" are multiple cores of tissue measuring up to 1.2 cm in length and 0.2 cm in diameter.  Submitted in toto in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the above diagnosis.\nA: Liver biopsy\n"

Findings reported to Dr. **NAME[XXX WWW] s office (**NAME[VVV]) on **DATE[Nov 31 2011] at 12:00 PM.  These findings are consistent with the clinical mass noted at 30 cm of the colon with the prior colonic biopsy (***PATH-NUMBER[1]) being superficial and limited in sampling the mass which is the likely primary site of the adenocarcinoma./r/n\nGrossDescription:\nLabeled:      Patient name and medical record number, designated liver core per the requisition only \nSpecimen:    Cylindrical (formalin)\nNumber:      Five\nSize:           Range from 0.4-1.9 cm length, each less than 0.1 cm diameter\nSubmitted/Block:    Entirely/1./r/n\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe liver needle core has a large area with apparent metastatic adenocarcinoma with a fibrotic stromal reaction with infiltrating gland forming malignant columnar cells displacing the hepatic parenchyma cells. The adjoining liver has focal limited leukocytes including some neutrophils with reactive changes with focal hemosiderin bordering the tumor involved areas with focal reactive portal triad changes.

Real-time PCR was using eight primer sets was used to amplify the region of the KRAS gene containing codons 12 and 13.  A set of eight probes was used to specifically detect the wild-type and mutant sequences.\n\nIntended Use:  The KRAS mutation analysis by real-time PCR detects the wild-type sequence and seven known mutations associated with codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS oncogene.  This assay is capable of detecting a mutation to 1% in a background of wild-type alleles.  The intended use of this assay is to aid the treating physician in the selection of the appropriate therapy for the patient.  Tumors harboring a KRAS mutation show relative insensitivity to anti-tyrosine kinase receptor therapies that signal through the RAS/RAF pathway.  The results of this study are to be interpreted in context with other clinical findings in patient care management\n\nPrognostic and predictive testing should be interpreted in the context of additional clinical and/or histopathological findings.\n\nThis assay was developed and its performance characteristics were determined by **INSTITUTION.  Pursuant to the requirements of CLIA  88, this laboratory has established the test s accuracy and precision.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, as the FDA has determined that such approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.  The results of this study are to be interpreted in the context of all other clinical findings./r/n\n"

Received in bone marrow fixative labeled \"right posterior superior iliac, **NAME[AAA] XXXXXX\" is a 2.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm aggregate of tan to red-brown material which is submitted entirely in one cassette.\n\nB.  Received in bone marrow fixative labeled \"right posterior superior iliac bone biopsy, **NAME[AAA] XXXXXX\" is a 1.5 cm in length x 0.15 cm in diameter core of bone which is submitted in toto in one cassette, after decalcification.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nPeripheral Blood:  CBC performed on **DATE[Aug 10 2012] shows a WBC count of 12.6 K/mm3.  The differential shows 18% segs, 43% lymphocytes, 3% atypical lymphocytes, 1% monocytes, 2% eosinophils, 1% basophils, 1% metamyelocytes, and 31% blasts.  The RBC count is 4.41 M/mm3, hemoglobin 13.3 gm/dl, hematocrit 38.1%, MCV 86.4 fl, MCH 30.3 pg, MCHC 35.0 gm/dl, and platelet count 129 K/mm3.  The peripheral blood smear reveals normochromic, normocytic erythrocytes with unremarkable morphology.  No rouleau formation is seen.  Leukocytes and blasts are present in a distribution corresponding to the reported differential.  Platelets appear numerically decreased and morphologically unremarkable.  \n\nBone Marrow:  The aspirate smears show well-stained particles with adequate megakaryocytes.  Hematopoiesis is minimal.  The cells largely consist of blasts.  The morphology of the blast cells ranges from small, round blasts with dispersed chromatin and scanty cytoplasm, typical of L1 lymphoblasts, to larger blasts with oval to irregular hyperchromatic nuclei, and scanty deeply basophilic cytoplasm with cytoplasmic blebbing.  Single nucleoli are present in some of these larger blasts.  The core biopsy and clot section show an average cellularity of 100%.  Scattered megakaryocytes are present.  The bone marrow biopsy and clot sections are largely replaced with sheets of small blasts with round nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scanty cytoplasm.  No extrinsic cells or granulomas are seen.  The bone marrow differential is as follows (300 cells counted):\n \n%Blasts73Promyelocytes/myelocytes1Metamyelocytes/bands/segs3Monocytes0Eosinophils<1Basophils0Red cell precursors6Lymphocytes17\nThe iron stain was unevaluable due to absent spicules.\nA: Right posterior superior iliac bone marrow aspiration\nB: Right posterior superior bone biopsy\n"

The negative synaptophysin and chromogranin\nstains would suggest against a neuroendocrine tumor, but there is a\nproportion of neuroendocrine tumors that could be negative for both\nmarkers.  The positive pankeratin and CK7 would be compatible with a\ncarcinoma.  Additional immunohistochemical staining for squamous cell\ncarcinoma will be attempted (CK 5/6 and p63) and the results issued as\nan addendum to this report.  These results have been reviewed with Dr.\n**NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Nov 23 12] at 3 PM.\n\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nLiver mass with a lung mass.\n\nINTRAPROCEDURAL EVALUATION:\nA.

B)  Right kidney, portion of right adrenal gland, right nephrectomy:   -   4.8 cm renal cell carcinoma, clear cell type, Grade 2 of 4.   -   Tumor is confined within renal capsule.   -   Negative soft tissue, ureteral and vascular margins.   -   No specific pathologic alteration, portion of right adrenal gland.   -   No tumor identified (0/1) hilar lymph node.\nGross Description: Received are two separate formalin filled containers, each labeled with the patient's name. A)  Part A is additionally labeled \\\"gallbladder\\\".  The specimen consists of a 6 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm pinkish-red gallbladder which has a smooth to roughened surface.  The cystic duct is patent.  The specimen has been previously partially opened.  Further opening reveals a pink-tan to dark red focally hemorrhagic velvety mucosa with no lesions.  Within the receiving container is a single black ovoid cholelith which is 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  Average wall thickness is 0.2 cm.  There are no lymph nodes identified.  Representative sections are submitted in cassette A. B)  Part B is additionally labeled \\\"right kidney\\\".  The specimen consists of a 333 gram right kidney, which is 9 x 6.5 x 4 cm.  There is a moderate amount of attached perinephric fat and an attached 4 cm in length x 0.3 cm in average diameter segment of ureter.  The superior portion of the kidney is notable for a small fragment of attached adrenal gland.  The outer surface of the kidney is inked blue. Sectioning the kidney reveals a 4.8 x 3.7 x 3 cm well-circumscribed mass lesion within the mid to inferior pole of the kidney.  The lesion has a solid bright orange to dark red, focally hemorrhagic variegated cut surface.  The lesion abuts the overlying renal capsule but does not appear to penetrate into or through it.  The lesion does not extend into the perinephric fat.  The lesion has a cortical location and does not involve the renal sinus or hilar vasculature.  There are no other mass lesions or cystic structures identified.  The uninvolved renal parenchyma is pink-tan with a well-delineated corticomedullary junction. Average cortical thickness is 0.7 cm.  The collecting system is lined by a pink-tan smooth urothelium with no papillary excrescences.  There is a single 0.3 cm possible pink-tan lymph node identified within the hilar fat.  The small attached fragment of adrenal gland tissue is 2 x 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  Sectioning the adrenal gland fragment reveals a bright orange to tan-brown cut surface with no distinct lesion.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette B1 - ureter and vascular surgical margins; Cassette B2 - inked perinephric fat overlying lesion; Cassettes B3 through B5 - sections of lesion to overlying renal capsule; Cassette B6 - lesion to uninvolved kidney; Cassette B7 - additional representative sections of ureter, renal pelvis and renal calyx; Cassette B8 - random uninvolved inferior pole of kidney; Cassette B9 - representative sections of attached adrenal gland fragment; Cassette B10 - possible hilar lymph node.

Status: SOUT. Final Signout: **NAME[XXX M WWW], VVV] PhD **DATE[Apr 19 12]\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: SIGMOID COLON, RESECTION INVASIVE, WELL-TO-MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA EXTENDING THROUGH MUSCULARIS MUCOSA INTO SUBMUCOSA. NO LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED. NO EVIDENCE OF METASTATIC CARCINOMA IN 16 LYMPH NODES. SURGICAL MARGINS FREE OF TUMOR. SEE COMMENT.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, number, date and \"sigmoid colon.\"  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of a colon segment measuring 12 x 3 cm.  The serosal surface is smooth, glistening tan-red.  The specimen is open and contains a moderate amount of yellow fecal material.  Also present is a mass on the mucosal surface measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm.  The mass lies 4.5 cm from the nearest surgical margin.  The mass is removed and serially sectioned.  The mass is raised, moderately firm, tan-pink.  No definite extension into the subserosa is identified.  The mass is totally submitted in Blocks 1 and 2.  The colonic mucosa is noted to be darkly pigmented blackish gray, consistent with melanosis coli.  The nearest colonic margin is placed in Block 3.  The more distant margin, lying 8.5 cm from the mass, is represented in Block 4.  The pericolonic adipose tissue is removed, serially sectioned and placed in lymph node revealing solution. The adipose tissues are examined and probable lymph nodes are removed and placed in Blocks 5 and 6.\nCOMMENT WORD: The sigmoid colon is found to contain a mass, measuring 2 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm.  Microscopically the mass is composed of invasive well-to-moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.  There is focal disruption and penetration through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa.  No lymphovascular invasion is identified.  There is no evidence of metastatic carcinoma in 16 lymph nodes.  The surgical margins are free of tumor.  Staging criteria: T1, n0 probable Stage I.  Histopathologic grade: G1/2, well-to-moderately differentiated.  Residual tumor, R0, margins histologically negative.  Histopathologic type: adenocarcinoma.\nSpecimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[1].

Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal\nantibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show\nappropriate reactivity. Interpretation of Ventana Pathway for HER2\nimmunostain is performed according to guidelines recommended by ASCO/CAP\nin 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:\nBlock A1\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\nHER2 3 +  Positive for overexpression\n\nImpression:\nInterpreted by:  **NAME[XXX M WWW] M.D.\nComment:\n\n1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A\nscore of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane\nstaining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is\ndefined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak\nin intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least\n10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining\nbut in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2\ntest) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any\nproportion of tumor cells.\n2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by\nimmunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in\nsitu hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as\nnegative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low\nlevel HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of\ncases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the\nvast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene\namplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene\namplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be\nconsidered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive\ntesting for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all\ncases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by\nimmunohistochemistry.

The specimens are placed in formalin between 1016 and 1230, \n**DATE[Feb 16 12], for a total fixation time of between 10.5 and 12.5 hours. \nThe first is designated 'left skin-sparing mastectomy' and is received without fixative. It \nis a 758 gm skin-sparing breast 21.0 cm from medial to lateral, 22.0 cm from superior to \ninferior, and 4.0 cm from superficial to deep. There is an attached 11.5 x 5.3 cm skin \nellipse which has an everted unremarkable nipple. At 6.5 cm inferolateral to the nipple's \nedge is a 1.7 cm healed incision. The deep margin has no attached muscle. Orientation is \nshort suture superior and long lateral. The specimen is inked: 2.0 cm band superior to \nskin ellipse -green, 2.0 cm band inferior to skin ellipse -yellow, remaining \nsuperoanterior margin -orange, remaining inferoanterior margin -blue, deep margin -black. \nThe specimen is sectioned from medial to lateral into 18 slices. The cut surface has two \ngross areas of interest which are separate. The first gross area of interest is in slices \n8-15 at approximately 4:00 to 5:00, 4.0 cm from the nipple, in the lower outer quadrant. \nThis is what appears to be a single irregular mass which is somewhat ill-defined and has \ngross evidence of biopsy. The mass is 3.5 x 2.5 x an estimated 4.0 cm on the medial to \nlateral axis. The mass is 0.4 cm from the blue inferoanterior margin and 0.4 cm from the \nblack deep margin. It is over 2.0 cm from the orange superoanterior margin, 1.5 cm from the \nyellow band inferior to the skin ellipse, and 0.8 cm from the green band superior to the \nskin ellipse. Intraoperative gross margin consultation by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] of: `4.0 cm mass \nin lower outer quadrant, 4 mm from deep and anteroinferior margins'. \nThe second gross area of interest is in slices 15 and 16 at approximately 2:00. This is a \n1.5 x 0.8 cm firm, circumscribed area which appears consistent with an interparenchymal \nlymph node. This is over 2.0 cm from all margins. \nSummary of Sections: \nA1 Slice 6 -nipple \nA2 Slice 14 -healed incision on skin which corresponds to more lateral portion of \nmass \nA3 First gross area of interest -slice 8, yellow band inferior to skin ellipse \nA4 Slice 9 -first gross area of interest, blue inferoanterior \nA5 Slice 10 -first gross area of interest, apparent biopsy site, blue and yellow \nband inferior to skin ellipse \nA6 Slice 13 -green band superior to skin ellipse and mass \nA7 Slice 14 -black deep \nA8 Slice 15 second gross area of interest -what appears to be an intrarparenchymal lymph \nnode, no marginal ink \nThe second is designated 'left axillary dissection' and is received in formalin. It is \nunoriented orange-yellow adipose tissue 15.0 x 8.0 x 4.0 cm. This has tentatively \nidentified lymph nodes up to 2.5 cm with several of these lymph nodes white and firm.

Labeled with name\nand date of birth:  **NAME[AAA BBB] and **DATE[Aug 9 51].\nA.   Container designation: \"sigmoid colon\"   The specimen consists of an\noriented (tumor on rectal end) 28 cm segment of sigmoid colon.  This\nspecimen is received fresh and opened for an intraoperative consultation\nfor margins.  There is a 7.0 x 6.5 x 2.3 cm sessile lesion with raised\nborders, 3.0 cm from the distal margin and 20.0 cm from the proximal\nmargin, and 5.0 cm from the radial margin.  The serosa is inked black and\nthe closest radial margin is inked green.  The tumor abuts the serosal\nmargin but focally invades into the pericolonic fat.  Three small polyps\nare identified in the mucosa ranging in size from 0.3 to 0.4 cm.  No\nadditional masses or lesions are identified.  Cassette summary:  A1 and A2\n  distal margin; A3   proximal margin; A4   closest radial margin en face;\nA5 and A6   tumor to deepest invasion; A7 and A8   representative tumor; A9\n  polyps; A10   representative normal mucosa; A11-A13   entire lymph nodes.\nINTRAOPERATIVE CYTOLOGY DIAGNOSIS   \"SIGMOID COLON\":  TUMOR IS 3.0 cm FROM\nDISTAL MARGIN AND ABOVE PERITONEAL REFLECTION.

Significant cardiovascular findings at autopsy included left\nventricular hypertrophy with extensive interstitial fibrosis compatible\nwith the patient's history of hypertension.  There was significant\natherosclerosis of the left main coronary artery with approximately 90%\nstenosis.  Additionally, the aortic valve showed prominent calcification\nconsistent with chronic degenerative changes.  The presence of pulmonary\nedema and chronic passive congestion also supported a diagnosis of left\nventricular failure.  Given the extent of Ms. **NAME[BBB]'s cardiac pathology,\nwhich was complicated by her history of multiple myeloma with chronic renal\nfailure, the autopsy findings support a diagnosis of sudden cardiac death\nmost likely secondary to a lethal arrhythmia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[WWW VVV], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Jan 07 2012] 03:28 PM\n**NAME[WWW VVV], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Jan 12 2012] 12:39 PM\n"

Carcinoma is present within a millimeter within the underlying subserosal tissue. Carcinoma within the adhesions or involving free mesothelial surface is NOT identified in the plane of sections examined to unequivocally support higher tumor stage. Additional deeper levels were examined from the blocks with closest extent of tumor to serosa/adhesions. The adhesions may be result to the inflammatory changes, seen around the carcinoma. \n\nIn one focus, carcinoma is in close proximity to mesocolic vessels. Some vessels have significant subendothelial thickening, possibly recanalized thrombus. However, tumor within vascular lumen is not identified in the plane of sections examined. VVG special stain was also performed and examined.\nINTERPRETATION:\n\nPlease note: Add Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] and the appropriate oncologist (Dr. **NAME[XXX] at **NAME[WWW]) to the additional staff to receive a copy of this report.

They should not be used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established diagnostic procedure or test. The DNA is purified from paraffin embedded tissue. Microsatellite sequences from chromosome 18q are amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from normal and tumor DNA. Paired normal/tumor products are separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained and scanned. For inquires, please refer to the LabCorp report specimen number # or call CMB&P Customer Service at  **PHONE ext. 4060.\nIn the event of Indeterminate for loss of 18q, insert at the beginning of the comment:\nIt was not possible to identify loss of 18q in the tumor specimen because of the genetic characteristics of the patient's normal tissue DNA.

Lymph node, station 7, excision:\n-Fragments of lymph node with anthracosis. \n-No carcinoma identified.\nMICROSCOPIC:\nUnless 'gross exam' is specified, the final diagnosis for each specimen is based on a microscopic examination of the tissue(s)/cells.GROSS:\nA. Received fresh, labeled ''**NAME[BBB, AAA] L'' and designated ''A. right colon'', is from a right colectomy with an 11 cm long by 2.5 cm in diameter terminal ileum continuous with a 15.5 cm long and 3.0-4.5 cm in diameter cecum and distal colon stapled at both ends. The attached mesenteric and pericolic fat is 26 x 5 x 2.5 cm. A 6.5 cm long by 0.6 cm in diameter unremarkable appendix is identified. The serosa is pink-tan with a 5 x 3.5 cm area of hemorrhage, tattoo and adhesions in the mid aspect of the specimen (distal to cecum). The specimen is inked as follows: proximal - blue, distal - black and serosa with adhesions/hemorrhage - orange. A 3.7 cm long by 5 x 1.1 cm fungating mass is identified adjacent to the hemorrhage/tattoo/adhesions on the serosa. The mass occupies 70% of the lumen, but does not obstruct the lumen. It is 3 cm from the ileocecal valve, 9 cm from the distal margin and 14 cm from the proximal margin. The cut surface of the mass extends through the wall and focally into the underlying fat, and is 7 cm from the radial fat margin. There are two broad-based possible polyps, proximal and distal to the mass. Polyp 1 is 0.7 x 0.5 x 0.3 cm and is 1 cm from the appendiceal orifice and 3.7 cm proximal to the mass. Polyp 2 is 0.7 x 0.3 x 0.3 cm and is 1.3 cm distal to the mass and 7.7 cm from the distal margin. The polyps are superficial. No other masses or polyps are identified. The surrounding mucosa has normal appearing transverse folds with focal areas of hemorrhage. The fat is thoroughly searched for lymph nodes and 20 possible nodes are identified up to 2.2 cm. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 - longitudinal sections perpendicular to margins; A2 - IC valve and appendix (with inked proximal margin); A3 - terminal ileum and polyp 1 with appendiceal orifice; A4 - mass in relation to proximal mucosa; A5-6 - central mass; A7 - mass with distal mucosa and tattoo; A8 - polyp 2 distal to mass and additional distal mucosa with hemorrhage; A9 - ten possible nodes; A10 - ten possible nodes; ***PATH-NUMBER[1] - one node, trisected. (**INITIALS:cmc10 275013)\nB.

JFJ/mbc\nGross Description Specimen 1 labeled right axillary lymph node, received in formalin, consists of a 10.0x10.0x5.0 cm aggregate of fatty soft tissue. Several enlarged firm lymph nodes are identified ranging from 0.8 to 3.5 cm in greatest dimension. Sectioning through the largest lymph node reveals a gray/white firm cut surface consistent with metastatic tumor. The lymph nodes are submitted in their entirety. Summary of sections: 1A-1H  one bisected lymph node per cassette; 1I  intact lymph nodes; 1J  representative section from largest grossly positive lymph node.  Specimen 2 labeled right breast tissue short superior long lateral, received fresh for frozen section, consists of a 257.2 gram, 11.5x9.5x4.5 cm intact lumpectomy specimen. The margins are inked as follows: superior margin blue, lateral margin green, and remaining margins black. A representative section of the medial and central anterior aspect are submitted for frozen section. Sectioning from the medial toward the lateral aspect reveals a 6.5x3.0x2.8 cm ill defined firm tan mass, 3.5 cm from the inferior margin, 1.8 cm from the superior margin, 4 cm from the lateral margin, 1.3 cm from the deep margin. The mass abuts the medial and anterior margins. There is an area in the central aspect of the breast which is extremely firm and slightly more well circumscribed. This area measures approximately 3.5x2.8x2.5 cm. The breast tissue coursing toward the medial aspect of the breast continues to have a firm slightly nodular appearance and is suspicious for invasive tumor. Representative sections are submitted for frozen section. Summary of sections: 2A  frozen section residue; 2B  lateral margin; 2C  inferior margin; 2D  superior margin; 2E  deep margin; 2F  mass taken perpendicularly to include the medial margin, 2G-2N  representative sections of breast tissue to include probable tumor submitted sequentially from the medial toward the lateral aspect every 1 cm for a total area of 8 cm.  HM/mbc\nMicroscopic Description Sections through specimen 1 show multiple lymph nodes with evidence of metastatic carcinoma. In total, eight of fourteen lymph nodes are positive for metastatic carcinoma. These do not show extracapsular extension.  Sections from the right breast lumpectomy show frozen section margin to have infiltrating neoplasm involving both the anterior and antero-medial margins. Sections through margins designated lateral, inferior, and superior show no evidence of neoplasm. Section taken designated deep margin show neoplasm well away from the margin. Sections taken from the neoplasm show a ductal carcinoma with lobular features. The pattern and focal single file appearance of the tumor cells is noted; however, there are rounded nests and tubules of tumor. At areas of worst differentiation, the cells show large vesicular nuclei with nucleoli. Mitotic activity is counted between 10 and 20 per 10 HPF. Some of the cells do show lobular features including cytoplasmic lumina. All of the sections submitted show evidence of neoplasm. Focal areas of ductal carcinoma in situ are noted. There are foci of low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ with solid and cribriform areas as well as areas of high-grade with high-grade cytology, luminal necrosis, and calcification. There is cancerization of lobules in these areas. The in situ carcinoma comprises approximately 10% of the total tumor volume. There is a perineural invasion and lymphvascular invasion noted.

The prostate gland measures 6.5x5.0x5.0 cm. There is a bulging nodule exuding from the urethra measuring 3.5x3.0x2.5 cm. The bilateral vas are present and average 3 cm in length and bilateral seminal vesicles average 3.5x2.0x1.0 cm. The prostatic urethra is probe patent. The prostate is inked as follows: right lobe black, left lobe blue, and sectioning reveals tan glistening nodular parenchyma. There is a large dominant nodule surrounding and compressing the urethra. The prostate gland is submitted in its entirety. Summary of sections: A  right vas margin; B  left vas margin; C  proximal urethra margin; D  distal urethra margin; E-Q  right lobe of prostate submitted sequentially from the distal toward the proximal aspect; R-EE  left lobe of prostate submitted sequentially from the distal toward the proximal aspect.  HM/mbc\nMicroscopic Description Sections of the radical prostatectomy specimen show negative urethral margins and right and left vas deferens margins. The right lobe shows approximately 30% of the lobe replaced by prostatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, Gleason grade 3+3=6. The left lobe shows approximately 15% of the gland replaced by tumor which is Gleason grade 3+3=6. There is tumor infiltrating the prostatic capsule, however, it does not perforate the capsule and no evidence of extraprostatic tumor is seen. Focally carcinoma is seen in the perineural zone of several nerves. Lymph nodes were not received with this specimen.

Glandular and stromal hyperplasia with mild chronic prostatitis and bilateral high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in remainder of prostate parenchyma.  Benign circumferential soft tissue margin.  Benign urinary bladder base margin. Benign but close urethral/apical margin (0.2 cm).  Benign bilateral seminal vesicles.  Benign bilateral vasa deferentia.\nGross Description: Received in formalin designated \"prostate and seminal vesicles\" is a prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles and apparent bilateral vasa deferentia.  The apparent right vas is 1.2 cm in length and the left is 5.0 cm in length.  The prostate gland is 34 grams and measures 5.0 x 4.5 x 3.0 cm.  The prostatic urethra is 3.5 cm in length and is patent.  The surface of the prostate is shaggy and tan.  The margins are inked as follows:  posterior orange, right black, left blue. The cut surface is nodular, tan and firm.  Discrete mass lesions are not present.   The entire prostate is submitted. Summary of sections:  1 - right apex; 2 - left apex; 3-16 - right aspect of prostate extending apex to base; 17 - right bladder base; 18 - right seminal vesicle; 19 - right vas deferens; 20-33 - left aspect of prostate extending apex to base; 34 - left bladder base; 35 - left seminal vesicle; 36 - left vas deferens.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description: The majority of the prostate gland shows glandular and stromal hyperplasia with scattered foci of chronic prostatitis and bilateral foci of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.  In addition, there is an invasive glandular neoplasm fragment focally on the right side and fairly extensively on the left side.  The neoplasm is mainly growing as well-formed individual glands with readily identifiable lumina.  These glands are extending between preexisting benign glands and are lined by cuboidal to low columnar cells with moderate amounts of cytoplasm and enlarged vesicular nuclei with focally prominent nucleoli (Gleason grade 3).  There is a minority component consisting of large fused glands into complicated cribriform-type structures with very irregular circumferences lined by similar appearing neoplastic cells (Gleason grade 4).  The neoplasm is extending into but not through the prostate capsule.  The neoplasm shows extensive perineural invasion even down within the prostate parenchyma itself in addition to out near the capsule.  The circumferential soft tissue margin is benign.  The urinary bladder base margin is benign.  The urethral apical margin is benign but close on the left side (0.2 cm).  The seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia are unremarkable bilaterally.  Tissue Code:  T1 Synoptic Template for Primary Prostate Carcinoma: Specimen:  Prostate gland with attached bilateral seminal vesicles and bilateral vasa deferentia. Procedure:  Radical prostatectomy.

Adjacent to the entry point of the guidewire, there is a 3.0 x 0.3 x 0.2 cm ellipse of unremarkable appearing tan skin.  The specimen is 8.5 cm from superficial to deep, 7.3 cm from medial to lateral, and up to 2.3 cm from superior to inferior.  The needle enters the specimen from the lateral superficial aspect.  An accompanying specimen radiograph shows a highlighted density at the end of the guidewire, with an adjacent metal marker from previous biopsies.  The lateral border is inked yellow.  The superior surface is inked blue.  The inferior surface is inked black.  The deep medial and superficial margins are represented by the junction of blue and black ink.  The specimen is serially sectioned in the medial/lateral axis from superficial to deep.  This reveals a paracentral 1.2 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm well-circumscribed nodule of firm white tan tissue.  At the superior edge of the lesion, there is a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.4 cm blood-filled biopsy cavity.  The lesion is 1.5 cm from the mid superior margin and 1.0 cm from the mid superior edge of the biopsy site.  The lesion is 1.0 cm from the mid inferior margin.  The lesion is greater than 1.5 cm from the medial lateral, superficial and deep margins.  The breast away from the lesion is composed almost entirely of fat and shows no additional abnormalities.  Sections are submitted as follows: 1A through 1E:  Entire lesion and associated biopsy site in relationship to closest surgical margins. 1F, 1G:  Medial margin closest to lesion. 1H, 1I:  Lateral margin closest to lesion. 1J:  Perpendicular sections through superficial margin. 1K:  Perpendicular sections though deep margin. 1L:  Representative section tissue, superficial to lesion. 1M:  Representative section parenchyma deep to lesion. The specimen was removed from the patient at 13:18 hours, **DATE[Oct 8 11].  It is described, sectioned and initially placed into formalin at 14:23 hours, **DATE[Oct 8 11].  **INITIALS 2:  Received in formalin labeled \"sentinel node #761\" is a 2.5 x 2.1 x 1.2 cm piece of fatty tissue which is found to contain a 1.1 cm soft pink tan lymph node within.  The lymph node is bisected and totally submitted as 2. 3:  Received in formalin labeled \"sentinel node #181\" is a 2.5 x 1.7 x 1.1 cm piece of fat, which is found to contain a 1.3 cm centrally fatty lymph node within.  All of the nodal tissue is submitted as 3. 4:  Received in formalin labeled \"sentinel node #391\" is a 3.1 x 2.5 x 1.1 cm aggregate of fat, which is found to contain a solitary 0.8 cm partially fatty lymph node.  The lymph node is bisected and totally submitted as 4. 5:  Received in formalin labeled \"sentinel node #496\" is a 1.5 x 1.3 x 0.6 cm piece of fat containing a 0.6 cm tan lymph node within.  The specimen is bisected and totally submitted as 5. 6:  Received in formalin labeled \"sentinel node #124\" is a 3.1 x 2.5 x 1.0 cm aggregate of fat containing a solitary 0.4 cm tan lymph node within.  The lymph node is submitted uncut as 6. 7:  Received in formalin labeled \"sentinel node #224\" is a 0.7 cm in diameter centrally fatty lymph node rimmed in fat.  This is bisected and totally submitted as 7. 8:  Received in formalin labeled \"sentinel node #543\" are two pieces of fatty tissue, 1.5 and 1.7 cm in greatest dimension.  Each is centrally indurated, suggesting a fatty lymph node.  Each piece is bisected and then separately submitted as 8A and 8B. 9:  Received in formalin labeled \"additional margin inferior medial stitch marks true margin\" is a 3.5 x 3.0 x 1.8 cm piece of rubbery white mammary tissue and fat, having a stitch midway on one broad surface indicating the new margin.  The surface marked with the stitch is inked black and the specimen is then sectioned and totally submitted as 9A through 9D. 10:  Received in formalin labeled \"additional margin superior medial stitch marks true margin\" is a 3.2 x 2.4 x 1.4 cm irregular piece of mammary tissue and fat, having a stitch midway on one broad surface indicating the new margin.

Palpating the biopsies reveal suspicious areas in at least 3 of the core biopsy segments. A portion of presumed tumor is placed in MammoPrint transport medium. The remaining tissue is then submitted in a single block.

The findings are consistent with a high grade mammary carcinoma. There is an inflammatory response present. The tumor measures 1 cm in greatest length. Vascular invasion is identified. Tumor is present on all 4 needle biopsy specimens. Special studies for estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, etc., are pending and an addendum report will be issued.

Some crush artefact and nuclear streaming.  No squamous or glandular differentiation. Overall picture not compatible with small cell carcinoma.  Breast FNA cytology is reviewed and is similar.  A panel of immunostains shows nuclear positivity for TTF-1, with cytoplasmic positivity for low molecular weight Cytokeratin (Cam 5.2), Chromogranin and Synaptophysin. CD56 is negative. Breast markers Mammaglobin, Estrogen receptor (ER) and Gross cystic disease protein (GCDP) are negative. Comment : Hematolymphoid neoplasm is ruled out by flow cytometry. Findings are compatible with a non-small cell lung primary neuroendocrine carcinoma. This service has been rendered in part by a resident.  A pathologist has personally reviewed the slides/tissue and has rendered and is responsible for the diagnosis that appears on the report. This case was reviewed at the Intradepartmental Consensus Conference. The immunohistochemical test(s) were developed and the performance characteristics determined by the **INSTITUTION Pathology.  It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical purposes.

This is submitted filtered through a fine mesh in NS-24883.\nThe collection time is listed on the accompanying requisition as 1402 p.m.  The specimen is submitted in Processor 2 resulting in approximately 20.5 hours of fixation. (**INITIALS **DATE[Mar 23 12])\n\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nSections contain three needle core biopsy tissues, each involved by enlarged ducts with intermediate malignant epithelial cells demonstrating mild variation in nuclear size and shape, increased chromatin, and diminished pale eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There is scant comedonecrosis identified.  No invasive carcinoma or angioinvasion is noted.  The remaining tissue contains stromal fibrosis and benign fatty tissue. Intradepartmental consultation is obtained.\n1A-1: DCIS, Intermediate grade\n**NAME[VVV M.

These cells\naccount for only 0.2% of total events. While some features are similar to\nthe patient's previously reported large B-cell lymphoma (XXXXX,\n***path number ******path number ***the significance of the current population is\nunclear given the small number of events present for analysis. Clinical and\nmorphologic correlation is required for complete interpretation.\n\nsignificance of circulating lymphoma cells in such low levels is uncertain;\ncorrelation with clinical, hematologic, and morphologic findings is\nnecessary for complete interpretation.\n\nThe CD34 positive blasts account for less than 0.1% of total cell events.\nAlthough the CD34 positive blast percentage is not significantly increased,\nthis does not exclude the possibility of a myelodysplastic or\nmyeloproliferative disorder. In addition, blasts do not always express CD34\nantigen. Correlation with clinical and morphologic findings is therefore\nrecommended for diagnostic interpretation and overall blast enumeration.\n\nThe case was discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Aug 15 12].\n\nMORPHOLOGY:\nThe cytospin preparation shows a predominance of neutrophils with subsets\nof monocytes and occasional eosinophils. Few lymphocytes are identified,\nwhich appear small.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nThe following antigens were examined: CD5  CD10  CD19  CD20  CD23  CD33\nCD34  CD38  CD45  FMC7  kappa  lambda\n\nBlasts:\nNo significant increase in CD34+ blasts identified; see above comment for\ndetails of interpretation.\n\nLymphoid population:\nThe B-cells account for 0.2% of the total events. In addition to the\nabove-described immunophenotype (see comment section), they are negative\nfor CD5, CD10, CD23 and FMC7.\n\nApproximately 9% of total events are CD5+ T-cells.\n\nMyeloid/monocyte populations:\nThe majority of recorded events are CD33 positive maturing myeloid cells.\n\nMonocytes identified by forward and side scatter characteristics, in\nconjunction with CD33 coexpression, account for 11% of total events.\n\n\nIf images are listed within this report, they can be viewed by authorized\nusers on **WEB-LOC, Pathology Express.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.\nThis laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement\nAmendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical\ntesting.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies (if performed) with the\nmedical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[YYY M XXX]\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Aug 15 2012] 05:36 PM\nSPECIMEN:\n\n\nReferral ID #:\n# Unstained Slides:\n# Stained Slides:\n# Blocks:\nSpecimen Type:      Peripheral Blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: Kappa vs Lambda\nA: CD5 vs CD20\n"

The specimen is partially surfaced by a 12.0 x 7.0 cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The everted nipple measures 1 cm in diameter. Sectioning reveals approximately equal proportions of yellow adipose tissue and dense white fibrous breast tissue. No masses, suspicious lesions or previous biopsy sites are identified. Representative sections are submitted. Summary of sections: 1A-1H  representative sections of fibrous breast tissue; 1I  representative section of nipple.  Specimen 2 received fresh for frozen section labeled right sentinel node biopsy is a 1.5 cm in greatest dimension tan/pink lymph node which is submitted entirely for frozen section, now resubmitted in cassette 2.  Specimen 3 received in formalin labeled right breast is a 653.1 gram, 25.0 x 19.0 x 5.5 cm intact right simple mastectomy specimen. The specimen is partially surfaced by a 12.5 x 7.5 cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse. The everted nipple measures 1 cm in diameter. The margins are inked as follows: superficial margin blue, deep margin black, and sectioning reveals a 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm area of ill-defined slightly firm breast tissue with a central metal clip. This area is located in the inferior quadrant of the breast and is 1.3 cm from the superficial margin and 2.8 cm from the deep margin. There is a second firm mass identified in the central aspect of the breast with overall dimensions of 2.8 x 2.8 x 2.5 cm. The secondary mass is approximately 3.5 cm away from the metal clip. The mass is 2.7 cm from the deep margin and 2 cm from the superficial margin. There appears to be an area of normal breast tissue between the biopsy site and the invasive mass. The remaining cut surface shows predominantly yellow adipose tissue with focal areas of dense white fibrous breast tissue. No involvement of the skin or nipple is identified. No lymph nodes are present. Representative sections are placed in formalin at 11:35 a.m. Summary of sections: 3A-3B  deep margin closest to clip; 3C-3D  representative sections of breast tissue containing clip; 3E-3H  representative sections of breast tissue between the clip and invasive mass; 3I-3K  representative sections of invasive mass to include blue-inked superficial margin; 3L  representative section of deep margin closest to invasive mass; 3M  representative section of nipple.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections of the left breast show extensive lobular carcinoma in situ characterized by lobular and ductal elements that have been overfilled by proliferation of neoplastic lobular elements. Lobules are frequently filled and the neoplasm extends up the adjacent ducts. Scattered microcalcifications are seen. The invasive lobular carcinoma is noted focally and measures 7 mm x 4 mm x 4 mm. The in situ component comprises approximately 90% of the neoplasm present and its size is difficult to estimate because of its presence in multiple tissue blocks and is estimated at between 15mm x 5mm x 5 mm.  There are extensive calcifications within the breast and these appear to be associated predominantly with two small tubular adenomatous proliferation one of which measures approximately 5mm x 5mm x 5 mm. Sclerosing adenosis is extensively seen within the breast tissue. Sections of the breast skin and nipple show no definite pagetoid intraepithelial spread and no involvement of the dermal lymphatics.  Sections of the right sentinel lymph node which has been bisected shows mild sinus histiocytosis. There is no tumor noted in the subcapsular spaces. The node is immunostained with estrogen and pankeratin which confirms no tumor identified in the lymph node.  Sections of the right simple mastectomy show a lobular carcinoma that is infiltrative and extensively present in situ. The infiltrating component of the tumor measures 22mm x 12mm x approximately 12 mm. There is no lymphvascular invasion identified. Lobular carcinoma in situ is extensively seen and approximates at least 60% of the tumor. The margins of excision are free of tumor; however, the deep margin is close and less than 1 mm (see block 3J). Calcifications are also abundantly noted throughout the sampled breast sections. Sclerosing adenosis is extensively seen within the breast tissue. Duct elements show only focal hyperplasia without atypia.  **INITIALS IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY RESULTS:  All controls stain appropriately including external positive, internal negative and external negative controls as required.  This tumor shows POSITIVE nuclear staining for Estrogen Receptor (over 95% of tumor nuclei) in the right sided tumor and left sided tumor and WEAKLY POSITIVE staining for Progesterone Receptor in the tumor and STRONGLY POSITIVE in the in-situ elements.  Controls stain appropriately.  COMMENT: 1% or greater numbers of nuclei staining of any intensity is considered a positive test in our laboratory. ER clone Ventana SPI, PR clone IE2, IVD approved immunohistochemical stains on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue.  **INITIALS ADDITIONAL IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY RESULTS (dictated **DATE[Aug 9 12]):  HER-2/neu immunohistochemistry on the left breast is strongly positive (3+), testing performed on Block 1C.

Specimen #1 - is labeled right obturator node and consists of three pieces of fibroadipose tissue measuring 5 x 3 x 1.5 cm. in aggregate.  On sectioning, there are three lymph nodes ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 x 1.5 x 1.5 cm.  The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in six cassettes - labeled \"1A\" through \"1F\", as follows:  \"1A\" - two small lymph nodes, \"1B\" through \"1F\" - large lymph node sectioned and entirely submitted. Specimen #2 - is labeled left obturator node and consists of one piece of fibroadipose tissue that measures 6.5 x 2.5 x 1.5 cm.  On sectioning, there are three lymph nodes measuring from 1.5 x 1.5 x 1 cm. to 2.8 x 1.5 x 1 cm.  The lymph nodes are entirely submitted in six cassettes - labeled \"2A\" through \"2F\", as follows:  \"2A\" - one lymph node, \"2B\" - one lymph node bisected, \"2C\" through \"2F\" - largest lymph node sectioned and entirely submitted. Specimen #3 - is labeled prostate and consists of a total prostatectomy specimen weighing 32 grams and measuring as follows:  4.5 cm. from right to left, 3.8 cm. from anterior to posterior, and 3.2 cm. from superior to inferior.  The right seminal vesical stump measures 0.6 x 0.5 cm. and the right vas deferens stump measures 0.7 x 0.5 cm.  The left seminal vesical stump measures 0.6 x 0.4 cm. and the left vas deferens stump measures 0.7 x 0.5 cm. The specimen is inked, as follows:  right lobe is inked red, left lobe is inked orange, and inferior-posterior aspect of the specimen is inked black.  Sectioning reveals a spongy cut-surface with a few scattered tan-yellowish areas noted on both lobes.  Representative sections are submitted in 21 cassettes - labeled \"3A\" through \"3U, as follows:  \"3A\" - right vas deferens margin, right seminal vesical margin; \"3B\" - left seminal vesical margin and left vas deferens margin; \"3C\" - right base \"3D\" - left base \"3E\" - left parabase circumferentially sectioned; \"3F\" - right parabase circumferentially sectioned; \"3G\" - right apex: \"3H\" - left apex; \"3I\" - right paraapex, circumferentially sectioned; \"3J\" - left paraapex, circumferentially sectioned; \"3K\" through \"3P \" - representative sections, approximately 70% of the right lobe from anterior to posterior; and \"3Q\" through \"3U\" - representative sections, approximately 70% of the left lobe submitted from anterior to posterior.\nTissues: 1.

Container designation: \"right colon\" --  The specimen consists of a\n12.0 cm portion of colon with two stapled ends and has a 4.5 cm attached\nappendix and 3.0 distal ileum. The specimen also contains two separate 5 x\n1.0 x 1.0 cm (inked black) and 3 x 2 x 1.3 cm (inked red) portion of flat\nirregular bowel tissue containing a staple line.  The proximal margin is\ninked orange and the distal margin is inked green.  The ileocecal valve\nappears markedly edematous. The circumference of the specimen ranges from\n10.0 cm to 6.5 cm (constricted).  At the constricted side, there is a 6.0 x\n5.1 cm circumferential partially cavitated/friable with heaped border mass\nwhich is 2.5 cm from distal margin, 5.5 cm from proximal margin, 4.5 cm\nfrom radial margin (inked red) appears to abut the ileocecal valve, and the\nserosa.  The soft tissue subjacent to the mass is inked black.  The cut\nsurfaces reveal the mass is penetrating into the subjacent soft tissue. The\nremaining mucosa appears unremarkable, does not reveal any additional\nmasses, polyps or ulceration. The cut surfaces of the appendix appear\nunremarkable and the attached fat reveals multiple possible lymph nodes up\nto 1.0 cm.

B)  Right breast, mastectomy:  Residual multifocal high grade ductal carcinoma in situ with luminal necrosis, prior biopsy sites, proliferative fibrocystic changes, and small hyalinized fibroadenoma, see Case summary below.       Lymph node:  Negative for malignancy.\nGross Description: Received are two parts, each labeled with the patient's name. Part A is received fresh for frozen section, additionally labeled \"right sentinel node\".  The specimen consists of a 1.5 x 1.0 x 0.8 cm pink-tan lymph node which is notable for blue-green localization dye.  The lymph node is serially sectioned and touch preps are obtained.  The specimen is submitted entirely for frozen section in one block.  The specimen is now resubmitted in toto for permanents in cassette A-FSC. Part B is received in formalin, additionally labeled \"right breast\". The specimen consists of a 690 gram, 20 x 17 x 5 cm simple mastectomy specimen.  The specimen is partially surfaced by a 13.5 x 7.5 cm pink-tan skin ellipse.  There is no orientation provided, such the aspect of the specimen would be larger, thus the fibrofatty tissue will be designated \"superior\".  The epidermal surface is pink-tan and smooth with no distinct biopsy sites, scars or lesions.  There is a 2 x 2 cm focus of reddish-purple bruising at the 7:00 to 8:00 o'clock position 4.5 cm from the center of the nipple. There is an eccentric 3.8 cm in diameter areola with a 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm everted nipple.  The posterior surface of the specimen is inked blue.  Sectioning the specimen reveals two distinct separate biopsy sites and a separate solid nodule.  The first biopsy site is located within the lower outer quadrant at approximately the 8:00-9:00 o'clock position and is 1.2 x 0.6 x 0.5 cm. This first biopsy site is filled with clotted blood and pebble white biopsy seed material.  The first biopsy site is 2.0 cm from the nearest deep margin.  The first biopsy site is also approximately 1 cm deep to the overlying skin.  The second biopsy site is located within the upper outer quadrant 2.0 cm superior to the first biopsy site.  The second biopsy site is approximately 1.5 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm and is located at the 10:00 o'clock position.  The second biopsy site contains no biopsy seed material.  The second biopsy site is also 2.0 cm from the nearest deep margin and 1.0 cm from the overlying skin.  Directly lateral to the second biopsy site within the upper outer quadrant, there is a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm solid white-tan nodule.  The nodule is also located at the 10:00 o'clock position and is 1.5 cm from the nearest deep margin.  The nodule has a solid white-tan cut surface.  There is a moderate amount of intervening slightly granular dense white fibrous tissue between the solid nodule and the two biopsy sites.  There are no other distinct lesions identified.  There is a single 0.5 cm possible pink-tan lymph node identified within the lateral breast tissue.  The remainder of the specimen is predominantly composed of dense white-tan fibrous tissue. There are occasional small cystic structures seen.  Additional received in the same container is a separate small fragment of fibrofatty tissue, which is 6.0 x 4.0 x 1.5 cm.  Sectioning through this additional tissue fragment reveals a grossly unremarkable cut surface with no additional lesions.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette B1     nipple base and remainder of nipple Cassette B2     deep margin overlying biopsy site #1 at 8:00 o'clock Cassettes B3-B6     biopsy site #1 at 8:00 o'clock submitted entirely from medial to lateral Cassette B7     deep margin overlying biopsy site #2 at 10:00 o'clock Cassettes B8 \\T\\ B9     biopsy site #2 at 10:00 o'clock, entirely submitted from medial to lateral Cassette B10     deep margin overlying solid nodule from upper outer quadrant Cassettes B11 \\T\\ B12     bisected solid nodule from upper outer quadrant Cassette B13     granular fibrous tissue inferior to solid nodule Cassette B14     fibrous tissue superficial to solid nodule Cassette B15     random uninvolved upper inner quadrant Cassette B16     random uninvolved lower inner quadrant Cassette B17     one whole lymph node. Sections are placed in formalin at 1:05 p.m. on **DATE[Feb 1 2012].  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description: A)  Right sentinel lymph node:  Sections reveal a lymph node demonstrating sinus histiocytosis.  Within the sections examined, there is no evidence of malignancy. B)  Right breast:  Sections of the biopsy site from the 8 o'clock position, and sections through the tissue surrounding the solid nodules show foci of residual high grade duct carcinoma in situ characterized by expanded ducts which are filled with markedly atypical epithelial cells with focal central necrosis.  Definite invasion is not identified.  A smooth muscle myosin heavy chain immunohistochemical stain is performed on multiple slides and no definitive evidence of invasion is identified. A lateral single lymph node is also seen which is negative for malignancy.  For further information see Case Summary below. CASE SUMMARY FOR DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU (DCIS) OF THE BREAST Specimen:  Breast. Procedure:   Mastectomy. Lymph node sampling:  Yes. Specimen laterality:  Right. Specimen integrity:  Intact.

Receptor studies:  See receptor studies below. Pathologic staging:  pTis;  pN0;  pMX. ER/PR SEMIQUANTITATIVE ER: (Negative): 0 % PR: (Negative): 0% Method and Scoring Guide for ER/PR: *    Performed upon routinely formalin fixed and paraffin embedded tissue. *    ER clone 6F11. *    PR clone 16. *    Scoring Guide: A positive result is based specifically upon positive nuclear staining within tumor cells, with an intensity graded from weak-mild to strong as noted above. If the result is >0% of any intensity, the result is considered POSITIVE, with only 0% staining considered NEGATIVE. NOTE  The immunohistochemistry methods utilized for the evaluation of ER/PR receptor and HER-2/neu status are considered semiquantitative, with results expressed as detailed above. These tests were developed and their performance characteristics determined by the **NAME[UUU TTT] Hospital Pathology Department. ER and PR receptor tests have not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. These tests are used solely for clinical purposes. They should not be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA '88), as qualified to perform high complexity testing.

Correction with morphology and\nimmunohistochemical studies is recommended to better evaluate this cell\npopulation.  There is no evidence of a phenotypically abnormal B cell or T\ncell population among the lymphocytes examined. Clinical correlation is\nrequired.\n\nMORPHOLOGY:\nThe cytospin preparation shows a prominent population of very large\natypical cells with moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm and 1-2\nprominent nucleoli.  A spectrum of small to medium and occasional large\nsized lymphocytes is also seen with admixed histiocytes and granulocytes.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nViability:  79%\nThe following antigens were examined: CD3 CD4 CD5 CD8 CD10 CD19 CD20 CD23\nCD45 FMC7 kappa lambda\n\nLymphoid population:\nPolytypic B-cells account for 33% of total events and have a normal\nkappa:lambda light chain ratio of 1.3:1.\n\nApproximately 55% of total events are mature T-cells with a normal CD4:CD8\nratio of 2.8:1 and normal pan T-cell antigen expression.\n\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.\nThis laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement\nAmendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical\ntesting.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies (if performed) with the\nmedical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[ZZZ YYY] XXX], PhD\nXXXXX Hematopathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[May 22 2012] 06:24 PM\nSPECIMEN:\n\nSpecimen:      Station 7 and Station 4R Lymph Nodes\nDate Collected: **DATE[May 22 2012]\n"

Lung, Right Lower Lobe, Radiologically Guided Fine Needle\nAspiration:\n     Non small cell carcinoma, favor adenosquamous carcinoma.\n\n<COMMENT>\nThe slides confirm a moderately differentiated non-small cell carcinoma\nwith a predominantly sheet-like growth pattern.  Immunohistochemical\nstudies (see below) confirm a squamous phenotype with uniform CK5/6\npositivity.  Focal areas appear to show some intracytoplasmic mucin and\nvacuoles, and the lesional cells in one area of the tumor are positive\nfor Napsin A and TTF-1, suggesting a partial glandular differentiation,\nbased upon this small sample an intermediate grade adenosqaumous\ncarcinoma is favored.\n\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nPatient is a former smoker who presents now with shortness of breath and\nis found to have a 4.5 cm right paratracheal mass and a 5.3 cm inferior\nright hilar mass encasing the right bronchus intermedius and associated\nartery on chest CT.

Received in formalin, labeled \"**NAME[BBB, AAA]\" and designated \"right\nlower lung\", are three 0.1 cm in diameter elongated portions of tissue\n0.2-0.3 cm in length, entirely submitted in A1. Prior to placing the\ncores in formalin, one air-dried and one alcohol-fixed touch preparation\nare made.  The air-dried slide is Diff-Quik stained.  The alcohol-fixed\nslide is Papanicolaou stained.(pcs/gdb/jmk/cds)\n\nB. The specimen is designanted right lower lung and consists of one\nair-dried direct smear, one alcohol-fixed direct smear and one 10 ml\nblood tinged needle rinsing fluid collection.  The air-dried smear is\nDiff-Quik stained.  The alcohol-fixed direct smear is Papanicolaou\nstained.  The fluid is used to create a single alcohol-fixed and\nPapanicolaou stained cytospin slide.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:\nDeparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate\ncontrols are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific\nfluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or\nall of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based\nmethod, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin\nfree multimer immunoperoxidase method.

There are no lesions or areas of yellowish discoloration grossly identified. Representative sections are submitted in cassettes 1 and 2.  The remainder of the tissue is totally submitted in cassettes 3 through 8. **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description: The glands are increased in number and most show focal mild architectural complexity.  For the most part, they do not show evidence of any significant cytologic atypia, back-to-back glandular crowding, or stromal invasion.  However, there are 3 of 92 prostate chips where there are small glandular structures that appear to be infiltrating the stroma.  They show well-formed glandular structures with central lumina lined by cuboidal to columnar cells with enlarged rectangular nuclei and focally prominent macronucleoli.  These glands focally contain eosinophilic crystals and are extending through the fibromuscular stroma without any apparent lobulation.  The remainder of the stroma is mildly increased in volume and shows no evidence of any hypercellularity or cytologic atypia.  The stroma does show occasional collections of chronic inflammatory cells, predominantly small lymphocytes. Immunoperoxidase stain for p63/keratin 34?E12 cocktail reveals basal lining cells around the majority of the glandular structures present with loss of basal lining cells in the three above-described atypical foci compatible with infiltrating carcinoma.

LIVER, CORE BIOPSY:\n     -    METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA (SEE COMMENT).\n\nCOMMENT:  The specimen demonstrates liver parenchyma with an infiltrate of\nmalignant glands lined by low cuboidal glandular epithelium.  No marked\nmucinous differentiation is noted.  Immunohistochemical studies, using\nappropriately reactive controls, demonstrate strong and diffuse staining of\nthe tumor with cytokeratin-7 and 19 and moderate diffuse staining by\ncytokeratin-20.  No staining is noted with TTF-1, ER. PR, CEA, or CDX-2.\nThis case was compared to the patient's previous lung biopsy which\ndemonstrates a mucinous adenocarcinoma, a tumor that focally demonstrates\ncells with glands similar to the current biopsy. The two tumors from the\ntwo sites demonstrate a similar immunostaining profile in that the lung\ntumor showed only very rare cells staining for TTF-1.  (Please see\nXXXXX; **DATE[Aug 1 12]).  Pulmonary mucinous adenocarcinomas are a subtype of\nprimary lung adenocarcinoma that can have diminished TTF-1 staining,\nhowever, another primary site cannot be entirely excluded.  The\ndifferential diagnosis includes adenocarcinomas from other sites such as\nthe pancreatobiliary tree, esophagus and stomach, among others.  These\nresults were discussed with Dr. **NAME[M. ZZZ] on **DATE[Sep 12 12].\n\nREVIEWED BY:  Dr. **NAME[M. YYY]\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: one.

However, the fragmented nature of this\nspecimen and the poor orientation of this mucosal fragment preclude\ndefinitive diagnosis of submucosal invasion. Multiple histologic levels are\nexamined. Clinical correlation is recommended.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION:  Number of specimen containers: 7  Labeled with name and\ndate of birth:  **NAME[BBB, AAA] and MRN **ID-NUM.\nA.

It is unlikely that this patient has Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC), however, 5% of patients with HNPCC have MSS colorectal adenocarcinomas.  Microsatellite stability in this neoplasm is associated with the presence of the mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2).  Microsatellite stability by PCR in cases with complete or equivocal loss of one or more mismatch repair proteins indicates the immunohistochemistry results were due to fixation or tissue processing factors or other unrelated epigenomic alteration.\n\nIdentification of microsatellite stable (MSS) and unstable (MSI) subsets of adenocarcinomas is important, as published data suggests microsatellite instability status is associated with prognosis and response to 5-FU based chemotherapy.\n\nREFERENCES:\nRuczkiewicz AR and Jass JR. Pathol Case Rev 9:163-72, 2004\nPopat S et al., J Clin Oncol **ID-NUM, 2005\nSouthey MC et al., J Clin Oncol **ID-NUM, 2005.\n\nMethodology:  Non-tumor/normal and tumor areas were identified and selectively microdissected.  The collected cells were lysed and genomic DNA was extracted.  A multiplex PCR was used to amplify five mononucleotide repeat regions from both tumor and matched non-tumor/normal DNA and amplified products were evaluated by capillary electrophoresis.  Tumors containing DNA that generated novel products and/or demonstrated a size shift of three or more base pairs when compared to products generated from matched non-tumor/normal DNA were determined to exhibit microsatellite instability.\n\nIntended Use:  Repetitive DNA is particularly sensitive to errors in replication and therefore dysfunctional mismatch repair genes result in widespread alterations in microsatellite regions.  Microsatellite instability (MSI) testing is used to evaluate five different microsatellite loci for instability.  MSI has been found in over 90% of Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC)-associated colorectal tumors and is a hallmark of this syndrome.  MSI has also been found in 10-20% of sporadic colorectal carcinomas and 5-FU therapy has been reported not to improve survival in these tumors in some studies (Benatti P et al., Clin Cancer Res **ID-NUM 2005)./r/n\n"

Right femur, reamings:  METASTATIC CARCINOMA, consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma\n\nB.  Left femur, reamings:  METASTATIC CARCINOMA, consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma\nDiagnosisComment:\nThe patient's previous breast carcinoma (***PATH-NUMBER[1]) is reviewed in conjunction with the current bone metastases.  There is similar morphology between both specimens, supporting the current bony metastases as representing metastatic breast carcinoma.  Estrogen receptor staining on the current metastases shows equivocal, to very faint estrogen receptor staining.  HER-2/neu assessment of the current metastatic tumor is pending. |\nGrossDescription:\nA.  Received in formalin labeled \"right femur reamings\" are fragments of tan-red soft tissue and hemorrhagic material measuring, in aggregate, 3.5 x 3.2 x 1.0 cm.  A large representative portion is submitted in blocks A1-A2.\n\nB.  Received in formalin labeled \"left femur reamings\" are fragments of tan-red soft tissue and hemorrhagic material measuring, in aggregate, 6.0 x 4.5 x 2.0 cm.  A large representative portion is submitted in blocks B1-B2.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA.  Sections contain small fragments of bone and fragments of soft tissue exhibiting metastatic carcinoma.  Immunostains (pan keratin, ER, PR) are evaluated and demonstrates positive staining for epithelial differentiation, and faint positive staining for ER receptors.  PR receptor is negative.  An immunostain for BRST-2 is negative in tumor.   \n\nB.  Sections contain small fragments of bone with occasional small foci of metastatic carcinoma.  Immunostains (ER, BRST-2) are evaluated and demonstrates negative BRST-2 staining and very weak, to equivocal, staining for estrogen receptor.\nA: Femur reamings, right\nB: Femur reamings, left\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nPROGNOSTIC PANEL SUMMARY\n\n\nHER-2/neu (HercepTest):      Positive for overexpression\n\n\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections, see image analysis report for complete analytic results.\n"

The specimen consists of one pink-gray soft tissue fragment measuring 0.1 x less than 0.1 x less than 0.1 cm. Two fragments of possible fecal material are also present. The entire specimen is submitted in (block A). **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections of biopsies of colon mass reveal two minute fragments of adenocarcinoma of large bowel with extensive surface ulceration.  The tumor demonstrates a complex back-to-back cribriform architecture with tumor cells showing enlarged plump nuclei, distinct round nucleoli and increased numbers of mitoses.  Tumor appears moderately differentiated, however, the volume of tumor present is inadequate for thorough architectural evaluation, or evaluation of invasion.  Associated fragments of autolyzed vegetable fiber are observed adjacent to the biopsy fragments.   BHT/js\n"

Moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma.      B.     Dense reactive fibrosis of background stroma with mild anthracosis.  Comment:      An immunohistochemical staining panel is performed, and reveals the tumor to demonstrate strong nuclear immunoreactivity to TTF-1 immunostains, strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity to CK7 immunostains and only weak focal immunoreactivity to stains for CK20.  This staining pattern would be consistent with lung primary.  Clinical correlation recommended.   Electronically Signed Out By Ben **NAME[M. ZZZ], MD\nGross Description Specimen #1 is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's name and \\\"left lung mass.\\\"  The specimen consists of two gray-white soft tissue core biopsies ranging from 0.5 cm in length x less than 0.1 cm in diameter to 0.8 cm in length x less than 0.1 cm in diameter.  The cores are inked with hematoxylin and are totally submitted in (block A).  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Serial step sections of fine needle core biopsy of lung mass reveal a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma infiltrating a densely fibrotic stroma replacing pulmonary parenchyma.  A small amount of anthracotic pigment is present within the background stroma.  The tumor demonstrates irregular serpiginous nests and ribbons of cells with occasional gland formations.  Tumor cells are enlarged with plump mildly pleomorphic nuclei, enlarged round nucleoli and varying amounts of pale pinkish-gray cytoplasm.  Increased numbers of mitotic figures are identified.  The presence of discrete glands, and large cell size would tend to rule out a metastatic breast carcinoma in this patient with a known clinical history of lobular carcinoma of the breast.   BHT/js\n"

Stains are negative for CK7, CK20, and TTF-1.  The histologic pattern and immunohistochemistry staining pattern are most compatible with squamous cell carcinoma.  It is however noted that while it is highly unlikely in this clinical contest,  urothelial carcinoma can show a similar staining pattern.  \n\nFindings discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] on **DATE[Apr 28 12].\nGrossDescription:\nReceived in formalin, labeled \"biopsies left lower lobe\" are multiple soft to rubbery pieces of tan-red tissue (0.5 x 0.3 x 0.1 cm in aggregate, 0.1 to 0.2 cm in greatest dimension).  The entire specimen is submitted in one cassette.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nThe microscopic findings support the diagnosis.\nA: Biopsies left lower lobe\n"

Localization is via a biotin-free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody. The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.\n\nSUMMATION OF FINDINGS: \n\nThe Estrogen Receptor (VECTOR-CLONE 6F11) is positive in 20% of the tumor cells showing 1+ to 2+ staining intensity. The Progesterone Receptor (DAKO-Clone PgR 636) is negative in 100% of the tumor cells. The Herceptest (DAKO) shows positive (2+ to 3+) staining, after evaluation of membrane staining intensity and pattern on the standardized  0-3+ scale. FISH is pending.\n\nNOTE: Positive Estrogen Receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells. Positive Progesterone receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.\n\nImmunohistochemical estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor test results are reported using the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria. If positive, staining intensity may be reported numerically 1, 2, 3+ or descriptively as weak, moderate or strong. \n\nNOTE: ASCO/CAP scoring criteria for HER2 protein over-expression by immunohistochemistry are as stated: Positive cases show strong and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive cancer cells (score 3). Negative cases are defined as those with no staining (score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (score 1). Equivocal or indeterminate cases show strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells or less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells.\n\n\n\n\nPQRS CODE: 3394F.\nGrossDescription:\nReceived    60cc bloody fluid for ThinPrep and Cell Block.\nA: Pericardial Fluid\n"

Received fresh for intraoperative consultation is a right upper lobe,\n13 x 4 cm.  The pleura is red-gray, mottled lightly with black streaks,\nsmooth, and glistening.  The pleura overlying the mass is inked black.  The\nresection margin is identified, 2 cm in length, and 0.5 cm in diameter.\nThe specimen is serially sectioned and palpated.  The cut surface reveals\nan irregular, poorly demarcated gray-white firm mass, 2 x 1.4 x 1.5 cm.\nThe mass does not appear to invade the pleura.  The bronchus is opened and\nthe mass is located 3.5 cm from the bronchial margin.  The stapled\nparenchymal margin measures 10 cm in length.  At the removal of the staple\nline, this margin is inked blue.  The tumor is 3.2 cm from the parenchymal\nmargin.  The remainder of the cut surface is red-pink and crepitant.\nOpening in the pulmonary vessels does not reveal gross invasion by\nneoplasm.

The submucosal surface has been exposed prior to pathology receiving the specimen by a single longitudinal cut the length of the specimen.   There are also 3 cuts measuring each approximately 5 centimeters in length into the thickened area described below.  These alteration were also made prior to pathology receiving the specimen.  There is no definite  exophytic or endophytic mass identified. Perforation is absent. After removing the distal margin, the newly created soft tissue margin is inked blue.  Near the distal portion of the colon proximal to the anus, there is a flattened area approximately 2 cm from the anus with the underlying submucosa thickened.  This is the possible location of the tumor prior to radiation and chemo.   This area is approximately 11cm in length.

DGD/mbc\nGross Description Specimen 1 received fresh for frozen section labeled right breast sentinel node is a 1 cm in greatest dimension tan/pink lymph node which is submitted entirely for frozen section, now resubmitted in cassette one.  Specimen 2 received fresh labeled right breast lumpectomy with needle loc is a 41.6 gram, 6.5 x 5.5 x 4.0 cm intact, needle localized lumpectomy specimen. The specimen is partially surfaced by tan wrinkled skin ellipse measuring 2.5 x 1.0 cm. The specimen is oriented by the surgeon and inked as follows: superior margin blue, inferior margin green, anterior margin red, posterior margin black, medial margin yellow, and lateral margin orange. Sectioning reveals a 0.8 x 0.6 x 0.6 cm ill-defined gray/white firm area, 1.5 cm from the superior margin and greater than 2 cm from the remaining margins. The remaining cut surface shows predominantly yellow adipose tissue. No other masses or suspicious lesions are appreciated. Representative sections are placed in formalin at 10 a.m. Summary of sections: 2A  lateral margin; 2B medial margin; 2C  anterior margin; 2D  posterior margin; 2E-2H  mass and surrounding tissue to include superior and inferior margins.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections of the bisected node show no evidence of metastatic deposits within the node on H\\E\\T\\E\\E;  Immunohistochemistry on the lymph node with pankeratin and estrogen on deeper sections also show no tumor in the lymph node. There is no evidence of granulomatous inflammation seen. Mild sinus histiocytosis is noted focally.  Sections of the submitted lumpectomy specimen show the site previous biopsy which is filled with multinucleate foreign body giant cells and an inflammatory infiltrate. Adjacent to the zone there is a lobular carcinomatous infiltrate that is approximately 2.5x1.5x1.5 cm in size. The infiltrate involves a number of the ducts and is seen approaching the anterior and inferior margins to within less than 1 mm. Tumor is not noted directly on the cut inked surface in any of the sections examined. No true lymphvascular invasion is seen.

Dr. **NAME[TTT SSS] has been notified. \n\nNote:  Although the findings in part C are atypical and may represent adenocarcinoma, there is insufficient cytologic and/or architectural atypia to establish a definitive diagnosis.  The negative staining for p63 and 34BE12 and positive staining for AMACR in a small focus of glands is not diagnostic of cancer by itself.  This pattern of staining can be seen in adenocarcinoma, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and occasional benign glands.  Repeat sampling maybe of help if clinically indicated.\n\nReference:  Luo, et al, Cancer Res 2002, **ID-NUM.\n"

Labeled with patient\nname **NAME[BBB, AAA] and MRN **ID-NUM.\nA.   Container designation: \"right colon and cecum\" --  Received unfixed is\na  right colectomy specimen consisting of terminal  ileum, cecum and\nascending colon 25.5 cm in total length, the terminal ileum measures 7.5 cm\nin length.  The proximal and distal bowel margins of resection are\napproximated by wire sutures and measure 3.0 cm and 4.5 cm in external\ndiameter respectively.  The serosa is purple-red with hemorrhage and\nexudate and sectioning through the hemorrhage demonstrates an appendix 7.5\ncm in length, 1.0 cm in diameter. Opening of the appendix demonstrates a\npink-tan glistening mucosa without masses, however, sectioning through the\nappendix demonstrates fibrosis in the wall mid segment.  Opening of the\nbowel demonstrates a lumen partially occupied by hemorrhagic material.  The\npink-tan mucosa is remarkable for a pink-tan fungating mass occupying the\nentire cecum, ileocecal valve and ascending colon 9.4 x 8.6 x 2.4 cm\ngrossly approaching within 5.5 cm of the nearest (distal) resection margin.\nSectioning through the mass demonstrates pink-tan necrotic purulent cut\nsurfaces with gross extension through the muscularis into the pericolic\nfat. The specimen is pinned out for optimal fixation and sectioning and\nsubmitted for photographic documentation.\nCassette summary: A1-representative proximal and distal bowel margins of\nresection, A2-representative tip of the appendix, A3-representative\nappendix mid segment with fibrosis, A4-appendicial orifice,\nA5-representative  tumor in cecum with ileocecal valve and terminal ileum,\nA6-tumor and cecum and ascending colon with ileoececal valve, A7 through\nA12-representative serosa overlying tumor cecum and ascending colon\nrepresentative, A13 and A14-representative vessels and mesentery,\nA15-additional section serosa, A16-representative serosa and abscess,\nA17-additional section of tumor and serosa.\nPresumed lymph nodes are harvested ranging from 0.2 to 1.5 cm in greatest\ndimension and submitted in their entirety in cassettes A18 through A23 with\ncassette A24-largest lymph node bisected and submitted entirely.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[ZZZ YYY], PA) (Resident:  **NAME[XXX WWW], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[VVV M.

The cells contain moderately pleomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei with irregular outlines, variably clumped chromatin patterns and variably sized nucleoli.  Within focal areas there are downward projections with irregular borders and without identifiable basement membrane felt to indicate the presence of invasion.  There is also underlying inflammation.  The depth of invasion cannot be assessed on the current biopsy.  Staging criteria: at least T1 Stage I neoplasm.  Histopathologic grade: G2, moderately differentiated.  Histopathologic type: urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma.  Further assessment for depth of invasion and grading of tumor will be conducted if additional tissue is received.\nSpecimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[3]. Tissues: Urethra. Specimen Comments:\n"

An attached suture identifies the 12 o'clock margin.  The tissue is oriented with the skin surface facing up, and inked as follows: 12-3-6 o'clock-blue, **DATE[Jan 9 13]-orange.  An irregular, pigmented lesion measuring up to 3.3 x 2.9 cm across is present along the epidermal surface.  The specimen is sectioned along the 9-3 o'clock axis, from 12 o'clock to 6 o'clock, and submitted in toto.\n\nKEY TO CASSETTES: \n1  -  12 o'clock end piece\n2-7  -  Remainder of 12 o'clock half, submitted sequentially from 12 o'clock to central\n8-13  -  6 o'clock half, submitted sequentially from central to 6 o'clock\n14  -  6 o'clock end piece.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nSections reveal a non-ulcerated lentiginous compound melanocytic proliferation with single junctional melanocytes predominating over irregularly shaped nests.  There is focally prominent confluence of single junctional melanocytes with upward migration in focal areas. The lesional melanocytes are pleomorphic with enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei.  This is associated with lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate, fibroplasia of papillary dermis, and scattered melanophages.  Rare small nests of melanocytes of similar cytology as the junctional component are noted within this area of dermal fibroplasia. Superficial adnexal involvement is noted. The lesion is invasive of the dermis to a depth of 0.415 mm.  It comes to within 1.58 mm of the peripheral resection margin at the 2:30 position and 6.5 mm of the deep resection margin.  Melan-A (red) and S-100 stains are confirmatory.  In addition, there is an adjacent scar.\nA: Skin, left cheek, 12 o'clock marked with suture\nAddendumDiagnosis:\nSKIN (LEFT CHEEK) EXCISION:Malignant melanoma in situ, lentigo maligna type, with focus suspicious for early superficial invasion (0.25 mm, Clark's level II, non-ulcerated, no mitotic activity), the margins appear uninvolved in the sections examined. (see note)\nNote: I entirely agree with your interpretation of this case. Focal single cell invasion is seen on immunohistochemical stains, S100 and Mart1.\nAddendumComment:\nThe above diagnosis was provided by **NAME[ZZZ YYY] M.D., **STREET-ADDRESS, **PLACE, MA, **ZIP-CODE (Report #**ID-NUM).\n"

It has not been cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary. This test may be used for clinical purposes. It should not be regarded as investigational or for research use only. Dynacare Laboratories is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988(CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGROSS:\nReceived fresh, labeled ''**NAME[BBB, CCC]' and designated ''A. right axillary contents'', is an unoriented 12.5 x 7.5 x 3 cm portion of adipose tissue which yields twenty-two 0.3-4.5 cm tan-pink possible lymph nodes. The remaining cut surface is composed of fibroadipose tissue with focal areas of bright yellow possible fat necrosis. Representative sections are submitted as follows: A1 - five possible lymph nodes; A2 - seven possible lymph nodes; A3 - axillary tissue; A4 - three possible lymph nodes; A5 - five possible lymph nodes; A6-A7 - one possible lymph node, sectioned; subsequent exam consistent with smaller second node; A8-A9 - one possible lymph node, sectioned; A10-A13 - one area, sectioned, with possible fat necrosis; A14 - possible fat necrosis.

Also received in the same container is a 0.2cm in greatest dimension irregular portion of tan, rubbery tissue, possibly consistent with skin.  The specimen is submitted in toto as 1A.\n\n  Container 2:  Received in formalin labeled right breast per the container and right breast mass punch biopsy per the requisition is a 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.6cm cylindrical portion of tan, rubbery tissue.  Skin is not definitively identified.  The specimen is submitted in toto as 2A.\n\n  Fixation of specimen reviewed and assured to be 6 to 48 hours. \nAC:lefb **DATE[Apr 12 2013].\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  Both specimens from the right breast mass consist of small fragments of invasive carcinoma with features of invasive mammary duct carcinoma. A portion of the tumor shows necrosis. Some of the infiltrating tumor nests appear to be in lymphatic vessels.  Intact mammary tissue is not seen. No in situ ductal carcinoma component is seen. The tumor is of nuclear grade 3 over 3 and is poorly differentiated (B and R score of 9). Immunoperoxidase stains show the tumor cells to be negative for mammaglobin, and GCDFP, and focally positive for BCA225. \n\nER/PR HERCEPTEST (QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION)    \nEstrogen and Progesterone Receptor analysis and the Herceptest (DAKO) for HER2 protein overexpression are performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block 2A) using immunohistochemical techniques.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TECHNICAL INFORMATION: \nDeparaffinized sections of tissue are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies, along with appropriate positive controls. Localization is via a biotin-free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody. The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.\n\nSUMMATION OF FINDINGS: \n\nThe Estrogen Receptor (VECTOR-CLONE 6F11) is negative in 100% of the tumor cells showing 0 staining intensity. The Progesterone Receptor (DAKO-Clone PgR 636) is negative in 100% of the tumor cells showing 0 staining intensity. The Herceptest (DAKO) shows equivocal (2+ to 3+) staining, after evaluation of membrane staining intensity and pattern on the standardized  0-3+ scale.\n\nNOTE: Positive Estrogen Receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells. Positive Progesterone receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.\n\nImmunohistochemical estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor test results are reported using the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria. If positive, staining intensity may be reported numerically 1, 2, 3+ or descriptively as weak, moderate or strong. \n\nNOTE: ASCO/CAP scoring criteria for HER2 protein over-expression by immunohistochemistry are as stated: Positive cases show strong and complete membrane staining in greater than 30% of invasive cancer cells (score 3). Negative cases are defined as those with no staining (score 0) or weak, incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of cells (score 1). Equivocal or indeterminate cases show strong staining in less than or equal to 30% of cells or less than strong but complete staining in any proportion of cells.\n\n\n\n\n\nPQRS CODE: 3394F.\n1: skin punch biopsy2: skin punch biopsy\n"

Received fresh for intraoperative consultation labeled \"left breast mass (stitch is sentinel node)\" is an excision of tan-yellow fibrofatty soft tissue measuring 4.0 x 2.8 x 1.0 cm.  A suture is provided for orientation.  By palpation there is a firm nodule grossly consistent with a lymph node measuring 1.0 cm in greatest dimension.  The lymph node is submitted for frozen section subsequently submitted in block A.\n\nB.  Received fresh labeled \"left breast mass (2 long stitch is nipple 1 long stitch is lateral)\" is an excision of tan-yellow fibrofatty soft tissue measuring 4.0 x 3.0 x 2.3 cm.  Sutures are provided for orientation and there is a centrally placed needle.  The needle approaches the lateral inferior margin.  The specimen is inked.  The superior aspect orange, inferior yellow, lateral red, medial green, anterior blue, posterior black.  The sutures marking the nipple area on the anterior aspect of the specimen in the superior medial quadrant.  Sections reveal a tan-yellow to white fibrofatty cut surface.  In the anterior lateral aspect of the specimen is a cystic, hemorrhagic lesion measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5 cm and located 0.4 cm from the anterior margin.  Specimen is serially sectioned from medial and lateral and submitted entirely in blocks B1-B11.  Note:  The sections beneath the nipple are submitted in blocks 2-4.  The specimen is placed in formalin at 1300 on **DATE[May 15 12] for a total fixation time of 6.0 hours.\n\nC.  Received in formalin labeled \"additional inferior lateral breast tissue one long suture posterior long lateral short medial\" the specimen is inked.  The superior aspect orange, inferior yellow, lateral red, medial green, anterior blue, posterior black.  Sections reveal a tan-yellow fibrofatty cut surface with no grossly identifiable masses or lesions.  The specimen is placed in formalin at 1300 on **DATE[May 15 12] for a total fixation time of 6.0 hours.  The specimen is serially sectioned from inferior to superior and submitted entirely in blocks C1-C6.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nA.  Sections of lymph node are negative for metastasis on routine stain.  Immunostain (Pan Keratin) is negative for micrometastasis. \n\nB.  An excision of breast demonstrates a previous needle biopsy site with adjacent residual invasive lobular carcinoma.  Tumor focally extends to within 1.0 mm of the anterior/subareolar margin of resection.  Other margins exhibit wider clearance, and are partially extended by additional excision (part C).  Immunostain (pan keratin) is used to differentiate inflammatory infiltrate from the lobular carcinoma infiltrate.  These stains support minimal 1.0 mm clearance from the anterior/subareolar margin of resection.  \n\nC.  Additional sections of breast exhibit fibrofatty breast tissue with mild proliferative and non-proliferative fibrocystic change.  There is a focus of atypical duct epithelial hyperplasia with prominent biopsy/cautery artifact.\nA: Left axillary node, Stitch is Sentinel node, sent 1141 (FS)\nB: Left breast mass, 2 long stitch marks nipple, 1 long stitch is lateral, sent at 1205\nC: Additional inferior lateral breast tissue, long suture - lateral, short suture - medial, 1 long suture - posterior\nAddendumComment:\nPlease see attached Oncotype DX.\n"

COMMENT:  Cell block is insufficient for further characterization of the tumor.   88172, 88173, 88305 \nGROSS DESCRIPTION   At the request of Dr. **NAME[ZZZ], a cytotechnologist attended a CT-guided fine needle aspiration of the right lower lobe of lung.  Three aspirations were done yielding three smears.  Also several aspirations were placed into formalin.  One of the smears was submitted for rapid H\\T\\E staining.  The results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] by Dr. Beattie during the procedure.  The remaining two smears were submitted for routine Pap stain.  The tissue in formalin was submitted for cell block preparation. \nMICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION   Smears consist of numerous small sheets and aggregates of malignant cells with large vesicular nuclei, many with large pink nucleoli with clumpy chromatin and moderate to abundant amounts of cytoplasm.  Cell block specimens reveal only a small amount of blood and no tumor for immunostaining.

Melanoma is essentially excluded. Breast\ncancer is essentially excluded. Markers supporting a lung adenocarcinoma\n(TTF-1 and Napsin) are both negative in this case. Further, markers\nsupporting squamous differentiation from any site (p63 and CK5/6) are\nalso both negative. The tumor does not show a small cell carcinoma\nmorphology.\n\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nSmoker; lung mass.\n\nINTRAPROCEDURAL EVALUATION:\nRight lower lobe lung (fine needle aspirate): \"Positive for nonsmall\ncell carcinoma\".\nPerformed by: **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY], M.D.\n\n<GROSS>\nA specimen labeled \"**NAME[BBB, AAA]\", and designated \"right lower lobe\nlung FNA\" per requisition, is received in 30 ml of CytoLyt collection\nfluid on **DATE[Dec 20 2011]. Prepared is one cell block. Also received on\n**DATE[Dec 20 2011] is one alcohol-fixed direct smear labeled \"**NAME[BBB, M]\", and\ndesignated \"right lower lobe lung FNA\" per requisition. The\nalcohol-fixed smear is Papanicolaou stained. One air-dried smear was\nkept in Olympia.  (lw/nd)\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nUnless 'gross exam' is specified, the final diagnosis for each specimen\nis based on a microscopic examination of the tissue(s)/cells.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:\nDeparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate\ncontrols are incubated with a panel of antibodies or a specific\nfluorescein-labeled (oligo)nucleotide probe.  Localization is via one or\nall of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based\nmethod, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin\nfree multimer immunoperoxidase method.  Results are outlined in the\ntable below:\nBlock A1\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\nTTF-1     Negative\np63  Negative\nNapsin A  Negative\nMammoglobin    Negative\nER   Negative\nCK7  Positive\nCK20 Negative\nCK 5/6    Negative\nPan CK    Positive\nMelA/Mart-1    Negative\nCAM5.2    Positive\n\nImpression:\nInterpreted by:  **NAME[ZZZ M.

Some tests have not\nbeen cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The\nFDA has determined that such clearance or approval is not necessary.\nThese tests may be used for clinical purposes.  They should not be\nregarded as investigational or for research use only.

The specimen is opened to reveal a 7 x 4.5 x 2.5 cm fungating\nmass, 2.5 cm from the distal margin.  A 0.7 x 0.4 cm polyp is present 1 cm\nfrom the appendiceal orifice.  There is also a 2 x 0.5 cm focus of brown\ninduration 2.5 cm from the ileocecal valve.  A representative section of\nthe large fungating mass is collected for XXXXX.  The specimen is also\nphotographed for further documentation.  Also attached to the specimen is a\n6.2 cm vermiform appendix averaging 0.8 cm in diameter.  The distal 14 cm\nof the specimen have an incomplete peritoneal reflection.  The\nretroperitoneal margin is inked red and the remainder of the serosal\nsurface underlying the large fungating mass is inked black.  Sectioning\nthrough the large fungating mass reveals a central area of ulceration\nmeasuring 2.5 x 2.0 cm.  The tumor also grossly invades to less than 0.1 cm\nfrom the inked serosal surface.  The mass also is greater than 1.5 cm from\nthe inked retroperitoneal margin (red).

Labeled with name and\ndate of birth:  **NAME[BBB, AAA] and **DATE[Oct 5 1932].\nA.   Container designation: \"sigmoid colon, proximal margin, distal margin\"\n  The specimen consists of five portions of bowel ranging from 2.5 to 18.0\ncm.  The two smallest portions are anastomotic rings and the largest\nsegment is sigmoid colon.  A suture identifies the distal aspect (inked\nblue) and the radial margin is inked red.  The external aspect of the\nsigmoid colon is focally retracted (inked black).  A 6.0 x 4.5 x 1.0 cm\nulcerated exophytic mass is subjacent to the retracted area and 4.0 cm from\nthe distal margin (closest mucosal margin).  The mass extends through the\nwall, 0.4 cm into the subjacent pericolic fat, abuts the serosa, and is 1.2\ncm from the radial margin.  The remaining mucosa is disorganized and\nedematous, and several uncomplicated diverticula are observed.  Multiple\nlymph nodes are identified in the fat and measure up 0.9 cm.  The largest\nlymph node is suspicious for tumor and abuts the radial margin.  Cassettes\nrepresentative in blocks A1-A12 as follows: A1 blue sutured anastomotic\nring; A2 other anastomotic ring; A3 mucosal margins from shorter segment of\nreceived bowel; A4 mucosal margins from additional shorter segment of\nbowel; A5 tumor to closest radial margin; A6 tumor to closest serosal\nsurface; A7 tumor and deepest extension; A8 tumor to normal mucosa; A9\nmesenteric vessel; A10-A11 lymph nodes; A12 sectioned largest lymph node\nabutting radial margin; A13-A15 additional possible lymph nodes.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[ZZZ M.

In addition, there are several vascular segments, averaging 0.5cm in length and measuring up to 1.0cm in diameter.  Neither the bronchus nor vessels appear to be involved by tumor.  The remaining staple lines are inked blue.  There is a 2.0 x 2.0cm area of umbilication along the medial aspect of the lateral basal segment.  The area of umbilication is marked with silver nitrate.  The remaining pleural surface is red and unremarkable.  On sectioning, there is a 2.1 x 2.0 x 1.1cm tan, rubbery to indurated and slightly lobulated lesion corresponding to the aforementioned area of pleural umbilication.  The lesion comes to within 2.0cm of the closest vascular and staple line margin and 2.5cm from the closest bronchial margin.

There is no overt histologic evidence of malignancy and the surgical margins of excision appear negative for malignancy. \n\n  This case was reviewed for consensus diagnosis through intradepartmental consultation on **DATE[May 22 2013].\nGrossDescription:\n  Received in formalin labeled left breast tissue reexcision anterior margin is a 6.0cm (medial to lateral) by 4.0cm (superior to inferior) by 3.0cm (anterior to posterior) irregular portion of tan to yellow, fibrofatty breast tissue, which is marked with a long suture designating lateral, a short suture designating superior and a midsized suture designating inferior.  The specimen is marked with silver nitrate and additionally overinked as follows:  superior aspect blue, inferior aspect green, anterior aspect black, posterior aspect orange, lateral aspect yellow.  On sectioning, there is a 2.0 x 2.0 x 2.0cm cavitary defect extending to the anterior and posterior margins, comes to within 0.5cm of the superior margin, 0.5cm of the medial margin, 1.0cm of the inferior and lateral margins.  The cut surfaces of the cystic lesion are red and roughened with surrounding tan to yellow, chalky and rubbery areas.  The remaining cut surfaces are yellow with fine fibrous tissue.  There are no additionally noted lesions.  Representative tissue is submitted as follows:  1A, perpendicular sections of lateral margin; 1B through 1I, random sections of cystic area to surrounding margins; 1J, perpendicular sections of cystic lesion to medial margin.  Please see diagram.\n\n  Fixation of specimen reviewed and assured to be 6 to 48 hours. \nAC:lefb **DATE[May 21 2013].\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  Slides reviewed.\n1: Left breast biopsy requiring evaluation of surgical  margins\n"

Added **DATE[Mar 8 2012]. (**DATE[Mar 8 12] **INITIALS)\n\n<COMMENT>\nFinal stains will be reported with amendment for review of pleural involvement.\nEGFR amplification and mutational status can be evaluated upon request if clinically indicated.\nTISSUE CODE 0\n**NAME[ZZZ M. YYY], MD\nPathologist\n**INITIALS **DATE[Mar 07 12]\nAMENDMENT COMMENT (**DATE[Mar 8 2012]):\nA VVG stain was used to evaluate the elastin layer in the visceral pleura.  There is no penetration of this elastin layer by the carcinoma.  The TNM classification remains pT1b.\n**NAME[ZZZ M. YYY], MD\nPathologist\n**INITIALS **DATE[Mar 08 12]\nINTRAOPERATIVE CONSULTATION:\n1.  Right lower lobe.  #1 right lower lobe - mass grossly identified.  Frozen section of bronchial margin negative for carcinoma.\n2.  Wedge resection right upper lobe.  #2 right upper lobe wedge - scar, no neoplasm identified.  (CTA)\n\n\n<GROSS>\nFour specimens are received, each in containers labeled \"**NAME[BBB, AAA M].\"\n1.  The first specimen is received without fixative for frozen section diagnosis in a container designated \"#1 right lower lobe\" and consists of a 168 gram right lower lung lobectomy measuring 14.5 cm from inferior to superior, 12.2 cm from right lateral to medial and 4.4 cm from anterior to posterior.  The bronchial margin is identified, grossly found to be free of tumor, and sampled for frozen section diagnosis (cassette 1A).  The stapled vascular margins are identified, and grossly found to be free of tumor (cassette 1B).\nAn apical/peripheral subpleural mass at the superoposterior segment measures 2.7 x 2.2 x 1.4 cm.  The overlying pleural surface is puckered and gray, but grossly appears to be free of lesion.  The puckered posterior pleura is orange inked and the bronchial margin blue inked.  The lobectomy is serially sectioned.  The solid subpleural lesion is indurated and gray with no gross evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis.  The nodular lesion is moderately well delimited from the adjacent uninvolved lung parenchyma.  The lesion is adjacent to multiple large vessels, but no vascular or bronchial invasion is grossly identified.  The subpleural lesion is approximately 2.3 cm from the proximal bronchial margin, as represented in cassettes 1E and 1F.\nThe uninvolved pleural surface is smooth, pale red-tan and glistening with no evidence of perforation, exudate or adhesions.  The uninvolved lung parenchyma is predominantly spongy, red-tan and crepitant.  The proximal lung parenchyma near the resection margin is boggy, congested, deep red and hemorrhagic (cassette 1J).  No intrapulmonary lymph nodes are identified, but close inspection reveals three anthracotic pigmented lymph nodes immediately adjacent to the bronchial resection margin, and submitted in toto in cassettes 1C and 1D.  The soft and black-gray nodes range in size from 0.6 cm up to 1.3 x 1.2 cm.  Representative sections are submitted in 10 cassettes.\nSummary of sections:  1A - bronchial margin (frozen section control); 1B - stapled vascular margins; 1C - one bivalved peribronchial node; 1D - two peribronchial nodes; 1E-1F - one longitudinal section of hilum including lesion with pleural surface orange inked; 1G - lesion with pleural surface orange inked; 1H - one longitudinal section of hilum; 1I-1J - uninvolved right lower lobe.\n2.  The second specimen is received without fixative for frozen section diagnosis in a container designated \"#2 wedge resection right upper lobe\" and consists of a wedge resection of lung measuring 11.0 cm along the proximal staple line x 3.7 cm in maximum width x 2.4 cm in maximum thickness.  The violaceous pleural surface is roughened with a thick and shaggy fibrous adhesion measuring 2.0 x 1.7 cm, and grossly appears to be peeled away from the adjacent chest wall.  Corresponding with the fibrous pleural defect is an ill defined, dense fibrous component measuring 0.6 cm in maximum thickness, and located 0.7 cm from the closest stapled resection margin.  The rubbery and white fibrous component is homogenous and has no evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage.  A second palpable gray-white and fibrous pleural nodule measuring 0.6 x 0.5 cm is sampled for frozen section diagnosis, as is the aforementioned dense fibrous focus.  The roughened pleural surface overlying the dense fibrous component is blue inked, and the smaller pleural nodule orange inked.  The proximal staple line is scythed away and the corresponding margin black inked.  The wedge is serially sectioned perpendicular to the long axis.  On section the dominant fibrous component has an homogenous gray-white cut surface with a vague chondroid appearance.  The uninvolved lung parenchyma immediately subjacent of the dense fibrous nodule is unusually firm (possibly atelectasis), as represented in cassette 2E.  The uninvolved parenchyma is spongy, pale red-tan and crepitant.  No intralobar lymph node is grossly identified.  Representative sequential sections are submitted in eight cassettes.\nSummary of sections:  2A - two fibrous pleural nodules (frozen section control); 2B - apex closest to largest pleural defect; 2C-2E - largest pleural defect; 2F - uninvolved right upper lobe separating two pleural defects; 2G - remainder of smallest defect; 2H - opposite apex.\n3.  The third specimen is received in a container of formalin designated \"#3 hilar lymph node\" and consists of two anthracotic and ill defined soft tissue fragments ranging in size from 0.9 cm up to 1.6 x 1.1 x 0.4 cm.  The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 3.\n4.  The fourth specimen is received in a container of formalin designated \"#4 inferior pulmonary ligament lymph node\" and consists of a black-tan lymph node measuring 0.9 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm and with a small amount of overlying and soft yellow perinodal fat.  The specimen is submitted in toto in cassette 4.  (**INITIALS **DATE[Mar 6 12])\n\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\n1.  Sections of the bronchial and vascular margins contain no carcinoma.  Sections of peribronchial lymph nodes contain extensive macrophages with anthracotic pigment, but no carcinoma is identified.  Sections of the mass contain an infiltrative well differentiated adenocarcinoma with moderate to marked cellular pleomorphism, high mitotic activity, and a densely  desmoplastic stroma.  The leading edge of the mass is surrounded by alveolar spaces filled with macrophages.  At the center of the mass there is fibrotic tissue with numerous small vessels.  An in situ component of the neoplasm is identified within this central fibrotic area.  Along the pleural surface near the mass there is extensive fibrosis and apparent mesothelial inclusions immediately adjacent to invasive carcinoma.  No vascular or neural space invasion is identified.  Away from the mass, the lung parenchyma has dilated alveoli, consistent with emphysema.  One small lymph node is identified within the parenchyma with no carcinoma identified.\n2.  Sections contain dense collagen with minimal cellularity along the pleural surface focally.  Beneath these fibrous plaques are areas of scar with small residual vessels and occasional residual bronchioles.  No neoplasm is identified in these sections.  Away from these plaques and scars, the parenchyma appears similar to that seen in specimen 1 with emphysematous changes.\n3.  Sections contain fragments of lymphoid tissue with extensive anthracotic-laden histiocytes.\n4.  Sections contain fragments of lymphoid tissue with extensive anthracotic-laden histiocytes.  No carcinoma identified.\n**NAME[ZZZ M. YYY], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Mar 7 2012] 4:12:13PM\n**NAME[ZZZ M.

Final Signout: **NAME[XXX M WWW], VVV] PhD **DATE[Nov 12 11]\nFINAL DIAGNOSIS: RIGHT BREAST, CORE BIOPSY INVASIVE POORLY DIFFERENTIATED DUCTAL CARCINOMA OF BREAST. NO LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION IDENTIFIED. SEE COMMENT.\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in a container labeled with the patient's name, date of birth, and \"right breast biopsy.\"  The specimen is received in formalin and consists of multiple longitudinal, cylindrically-shaped portions of yellow-white tissue, measuring 3 x 0.2 cm. The specimen is totally submitted in one block.\nCOMMENT WORD: The microscopic sections of core biopsy from the right breast reveal an atypical epithelial proliferation forming variably sized clusters.  The neoplasm extends into adipose tissues and there is chronic inflammation as well as desmoplastic reaction.  The cells contain large, moderately pleomorphic nuclei with variably clumped chromatin patterns, irregular outlines and variably sized nucleoli.  Mitoses are easily identified, oftentimes multiple per high-power field.  The biopsy is felt to demonstrate the presence of invasive poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma.  The longest continuous segment of neoplasm in the submitted biopsy tissue measures 8 mm. in length.  Staging criteria will be completed if additional tissue is received.  Histopathologic grade: tubule formation 3, nuclear pleomorphism 2 and mitotic count 3 for a total score of 8 points, a Grade III, G3 high histologic grade neoplasm.  Histopathologic type: invasive ductal carcinoma.  The breast tumor profile analysis will be performed and reported separately.\nSpecimen Number: ***PATH-NUMBER[1]. Tissues: Right breast.

Received fresh, labeled \"**NAME[BBB, AAA M]\", and designated \"left\nbreast\" and is submitted for rapid evaluation yielding the above\nintraprocedural evaluation by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY]. The above\nintraprocedural evaluation is called into Dr. **NAME[XXX] in the operating\nroom by Dr. **NAME[YYY]. It consists of an oriented simple mastectomy\nspecimen with a single suture designated as marking medial. It is 418\ngrams, 16 cm superior to inferior, by 12.5 cm medial to lateral, by 5 cm\nsuperficial to deep. It is without an axillary tail. It is partially\ncovered by a 6.5 x 5 cm ellipse of unremarkable skin with a 1.2 x 1 cm\neverted nipple. Prior to dissection, it is inked as follows:  Superior\nsuperficial orange, inferior superficial green, and deep black. It Is\nthen sectioned from medial to lateral into 19 cross-sectional slices\nnumbered respectively. The cut surfaces are 30% fibrous and 70% fatty.\nSlices 3-7 (mid to superior) have a 2.3 x 2 x 1.8 cm ill-defined\nhemorrhagic area that is less than 0.1 cm from the superior superficial\nsurface, 5.3 cm from the nipple, 1.8 cm from the deep margin, and 4 cm\nfrom the superior skin margin. Within this hemorrhagic area in slices 5\nand 6 is a 1.5 x 1.1 x 1 cm ill-defined, firm, white-pink nodular area\nthat is 1.2 cm from the deep margin, 1.1 cm from the superior\nsuperficial margin, 5.5 cm from the nipple, and 6 cm from the superior\nskin margin. The tumor has a centrally placed M-clip. This hemorrhagic\narea and nodular area correlate with the prior biopsy at 11 o'clock.\nSlices 7-10 (mid to superior) have a 1.5 x 1 x 0.7 cm ill-defined,\nhemorrhagic, fibrous area with calcified material. This area is 3 cm\nfrom the superior skin margin, less than 0.1-0.2 cm from the superior\nsuperficial margin, 2.8 cm from the hemorrhagic area, 3 cm from the\nnipple, and 5 cm from the deep margin. This biopsy has a metallic clip.\nThis second area correlates with the prior 1 o'clock biopsy site.\n\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows: A1- nipple; A2- middle\nof slice 1 medial aspect-uninked, superior and inferior slice 2; A3-\nmedial aspect of hemorrhagic area in slice 3 including superficial\nmargin; A4- hemorrhagic area from slice 4; A5, A6- nodular area within\nhemorrhagic area of slices 5 and 6 (A6 includes superficial margin); A7-\ndeep margin from slices 5 and 6; A8- hemorrhagic area from slice 7 (most\nlateral aspect of larger hemorrhagic area); A9- tissue from the middle\nof slice 7 between hemorrhagic area in slices 3-7 and ill-defined\nhemorrhagic fibrous area with calcified material in slices 7-10; A10-\nsuperior and inferior slice 7; A11-A13- second ill-defined hemorrhagic\nfibrous area with calcified material from slices 7 through 10; A14- mid\ndeep, superior, and inferior slice 10; A15- middle uninked, superior,\nand inferior slice 13; A16- superior and inferior slice 16 and\nmiddle-uninked slice 19. kjh/ct\n\nB.

Occasional larger cells with distinct\nnucleoli are also present.\n\nFLOW CYTOMETRY:\nThe following antigens were examined: CD3 CD4 CD5 CD8 CD10 CD19 CD20 CD23\nCD38 CD45 FMC7 kappa lambda\n\nLymphoid population:\nMonoclonal B-cell population identified, see comment above.  These cells do\nnot express CD10 or FMC7.\n\nApproximately 12% of total events are mature T-cells with a normal CD4:CD8\nratio of 2:1 and normal pan T-cell antigen expression.\n\n\nIf images are listed within this report, they can be viewed by authorized\nusers on **WEB-LOC, Pathology Express.\n\nThis test was developed and its performance characteristics determined by\nXXXXX.  It has not been cleared or approved by the\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA has determined that such\nclearance or approval is not necessary.  This test is used for clinical\npurposes.  It should not be regarded as investigational or for research.\nThis laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement\nAmendments of 1988 (CLIA) as qualified to perform high complexity clinical\ntesting.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies (if performed) with the\nmedical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[YYY M XXX]\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Jun 26 2012] 02:42 PM\nSPECIMEN:\n\n\nReferral ID #:\n# Unstained Slides:\n# Stained Slides:\n# Blocks:\nSpecimen Type:      Peripheral Blood\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA: CD5 and CD23 positive B-cell population\nA: CD38 negative B-cells\n"

The findings are certainly histologically compatible with a\nprimary lung squamous cell carcinoma. However, given the suggestion of an\nanterior mediastinal mass and the unusual clinical course per the patient's\nelectronic medical record, a bland, low grade thymic tumor with squamous\nfeatures is certainly possible.

PATHOLOGIST's COMMENTS  Pathologic stage:  pT2a pN0 pMn/a. \nGROSS DESCRIPTION  A.  Received fresh for frozen section designated \\\"right upper lobe\\\" is a 72 gram wedge of red-tan lung parenchyma measuring 13.0 x 5.5 x 4.3 cm.  A staple line closes the specimen along one edge.  Pleural puckering is noted, 2.2 cm from the stapled margin.  The pleural surface is marked with black ink and the specimen is serially sectioned.  Sectioning reveals a well circumscribed gray-tan tumor mass measuring 2.3 x 1.8 x 2.0 cm.  The tumor abuts the inked pleural surface and is located 1.9 cm from the stapled margin.  A touch prep is prepared and a representative section of the tumor is submitted on a single block for frozen section.  Following frozen section, the specimen is submitted in cassette A-FSC.  Additional representative sections from the specimen are submitted as follows: A1.    representative lung parenchyma immediately adjacent to tumor A2-A5.    tumor and overlying inked pleural surface A6.    additional representative section of tumor and unremarkable lung parenchyma A7.    representative section of non involved lung parenchyma  Note:  A representative portion of the tumor is sent to Precision Therapeutics per Dr.   **NAME[XXX YYY].  B.  Received fresh for frozen section designated \\\"right upper lobe\\\" is a 144 gram lobectomy specimen measuring 16.0 x 9.0 x up to 4.0 cm.  The stapled bronchial margin is identified and is located 2.5 cm from the previous staple line of the concurrent wedge resection.  The staple line is removed and the margin is shaved and submitted on a single block for frozen section.  Following frozen section, the specimen is submitted in cassette B-FSC.  The pleural surface is smooth and glistening with focal spongy pale pink-tan lung parenchyma noted.  Opening the bronchial structure fails to reveal the presence of distinct tumor.  All vascular margins are shaved and submitted.  The vascular structures display unremarkable red-tan, smooth, shiny endothelium without tumor involvement.  Further sectioning fails to reveal additional nodules or masses within the lung parenchyma.  Multiple peribronchial lymph node candidates are identified measuring up to 0.8 cm in greatest dimension.  Multiple representative sections from the specimen are submitted as follows: B1.    shaved vascular margins B2-B4.    representative sections of lung parenchyma B5.    four intact lymph node candidates B6.    four intact lymph node candidates B7.    two intact lymph node candidates  C.  Received fresh designated \\\"N2 lymph node\\\" is a single brown-tan lymph node candidate measuring 2.3 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm.  The specimen is sectioned and entirely submitted in cassette C.  D.  Received fresh designated \\\"N1 lymph nodes\\\" are multiple irregular fragments of brown-tan to black soft tissue ranging in size from 0.5 to 1.5 cm.  The specimens are entirely submitted in cassettes D1 and D2.  **INITIALS \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  A.  8 H\\T\\E, 2 elastic stains - elastic stains are utilized to assist in evaluation of visceral pleura for tumor invasion, control reacts appropriately.

This diagnosis is consistent\n  with the absence of the 8;21 translocation or fusion product associated with\n  AML M2.\n  No evidence of a translocation between chromosomes 15 and 17 was found by\n  IFISH using a dual color probe designed to detect the fusion of PML\n  (promyelocytic leukemia gene) at 15q22 and RARA (retinoic acid receptor alpha\n  gene) at 17q21.  The percentage of abnormal configurations of the signals\n  suggestive of fusion events in 200 nuclei screened was not significantly\n  different from that found in a series of normal control samples.  The ISCN\n  description of these normal results is nuc ish(PML,RARA)x2[200/200].  This\n  diagnosis is consistent with the absence of the 15;17 translocation or fusion\n  product associated with APL (AML M3).\n  No evidence of an inversion in chromosome 16 was detected by IFISH using a\n  dual color probe designed to detect the inversion.

COLON\nB) LIVER Bx\n<GROSS>\n  A) Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"#1\",\nrequisition additionally stating \"right colon\" is a 3.5 cm long, 2.5 cm in\ndiameter portion of terminal ileum contiguous with a 17.5 cm long by 4.0\ncm in average diameter segment of large bowel which includes cecum and\nascending colon, with a moderate amount of attached mesenteric adipose\ntissue. The appendix is surgically absent. The serosa is purple-tan,\nfocally dusky with numerous membranous adhesions and is remarkable for a\n2.5 x 2.5 cm focus of retraction and puckering 6.0 cm from the distal\nresection margin. This focus is marked with silver nitrate. The specimen\nis opened to demonstrate a 5.0 x 5.0 x 1.7 cm plaque-like mass lesion with\ncentral ulceration and heaped-up borders. This mass lesion corresponds to\nthe aforementioned focus of serosal retraction and comes to within 3.8 cm\nof the distal resection margin at closest approach and is grossly clear of\nthe proximal resection margin. Sectioning reveals gray-tan homogenous,\nindurated cut surfaces and the maximum tumor thickness is 2.0 cm. The\nlesion extends into and through the bowel muscularis and into the adjacent\nmesenteric adipose tissue, grossly abutting the silver nitrate-marked\npuckered, retracted serosa. Additionally, the specimen demonstrates four\nbrown-tan, granular, sessile mucosal polyps ranging from 0.4 cm up to 2.8\ncm in greatest dimension which are located within the cecum.  The largest\nlesion (2.8 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm) focally abuts the ileocecal valve and\nsectioning reveals brown-tan granular cut surfaces which are grossly\nconfined to the mucosa. No additional discrete lesions are noted and the\nremaining, uninvolved bowel mucosa is tan, focally granular and\nconvoluted. The attached mesenteric adipose tissue is palpated, dissected\nfor lymph node candidates and thirty are identified ranging from 0.3 cm up\nto 0.9 cm in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as\nfollows: \nA1) Proximal resection margin. \nA2) Distal resection margin. \nA3) Ileocecal valve. \nA4-A6) Representative mass lesion. \nA7) Representative largest mucosal polyp. \nA8) Smaller mucosal polyps. \nA9) Uninvolved bowel wall. \nA10-A14) Six lymph node candidates submitted in toto, each. \nAlso received in the container are two bowel segments which are\narbitrarily designated \"A and B\". Bowel segment \"A\" is 2.6 cm long by 1.7\ncm in diameter with a small amount of attached mesenteric adipose tissue\nwith no palpable lymph nodes. The focally intact serosa is pink-tan,\nsmooth, glistening and grossly unremarkable. The specimen demonstrates one\nstapled resection margin and one opened margin. The staple line is\nremoved, the underlying parenchyma is inked orange and the specimen is\nopened to demonstrate grossly unremarkable tan, granular and convoluted\nmucosa. No discrete lesions are grossly appreciated. \nBowel segment \"B\" is 4.0 cm long by approximately 4.0 cm in diameter with\na scant amount of attached mesenteric adipose tissue. The serosa is tan,\nsmooth, glistening and grossly unremarkable. The bowel segment\ndemonstrates two stapled resection margins which are removed and the\nunderlying parenchyma is differentially inked. The specimen is opened to\ndemonstrate grossly unremarkable pink-tan granular and convoluted mucosa\nthroughout. No discrete lesions are grossly appreciated. Representative\nsections are submitted as follows:\nA15) Bowel segment A. \nA16) Bowel segment B. \nB) Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"#2\",\nrequisition additionally stating \"liver biopsy\" are four white and tan\nsoft tissue needle cores, 5.0 cm in aggregate length, AE/(4).\n<MICROSCOPIC>\n  A) Features are of a high-grade colonic adenocarcinoma with mucinous\ndifferentiation (representing approximately 20% tumor component in\nsections examined).  Carcinoma invades through muscularis propria into\nsubserosa.  \nB) In a background of non-cirrhotic liver parenchyma, sections demonstrate\ninvasive adenocarcinoma with morphologic similarity to the identified\ncolonic adenocarcinoma.\n"

Tumor is present also just beneath the dermis of overlying skin.  The included skeletal muscle is presumed to be pectoralis muscle.  For this reason, the T stage is not coded as T4.  Although the area grossly suspicious for tumor measured 5 cm in maximum gross dimension, additional tumor present on slide N, which was approximately 1 cm lateral to this lesion.  The maximum gross dimension of tumor is felt to be closer to 6 cm in greatest dimension. **INITIALS  Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[ZZZ], M.D., **PLACE\nGross Description Received in formalin labeled \"left breast suture is lateral\" is a 261-gram left simple mastectomy specimen, oriented by skin on the anterior surface and a stitch at the lateral edge.  The specimen is 15.0 cm from superior to inferior, 15.1 cm from medial to lateral, and 3.4 cm from superficial to deep.  The superficial surface is partially covered by a 13.1 x 5.3 x 0.3 cm ellipse of white tan skin, which includes a 2.6-cm in diameter pale areola with a central 1.1 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm pale nipple.  Near the superior medial skin margin, there is a parallel 4.5 cm scar.  The scar varies from 0.1 to 0.3 cm from the superior skin margin.  The skin is also remarkable for a 1.7 x 0.5 cm scar over the upper outer quadrant.  The superior and inferior soft tissue margins are composed of lobulated fatty tissue.  The deep margin is partially covered by fascia and has a central adherent 5.7 x 5.3 x 0.7 cm aggregate of skeletal muscle.  A metal clip is also present near the deep lateral margin.  The superior soft tissue margin is inked blue, the inferior soft tissue margin is inked yellow and the deep soft tissue margin is inked black.  The specimen is then serially sectioned from medial to lateral.  This reveals a poorly defined 5 x 4 x 3 cm area of firm white fibrous-like tissue within the mid and mid lateral aspect of the specimen.  This area is suspicious for tumor. Within this poorly defined area of induration, a small metal marker is identified within the upper outer quadrant.  This is the only evidence seen of previous biopsy.  The remainder of the specimen is composed of rubbery white mammary tissue and fat.  No lymph nodes are identified.  Representative sections are submitted as follows: A:  Nipple and areola. B, C:  Dimpled scar adjacent to superior medial skin margin. D:  Representative section scar away from margin. E:  Tissue from which metal marker is removed and relationship to deep margin. F:  Closest superior superficial margin to area of apparent previous biopsy. G through K:  Additional sections of indurated tissue in relationship to deep margin. L:  Random section upper inner quadrant. M:  Random section lower inner quadrant. N:  Random section upper outer quadrant, 1 cm lateral to lesional area. O:  Random section, lower outer quadrant, lateral to central indurated area. The specimen is removed from the patient at 14:20 hours, **DATE[Mar 8 12], and is initially placed into formalin at 14:42 hours, **DATE[Mar 8 12].  The specimen is described, sectioned and resubmitted into formalin at 15:46 hours, **DATE[Mar 8 12].  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Incorporated in diagnosis.\n"

A touch imprint was done.  The node is submitted entirely in one cassette.\n\nB.  Received in formalin labeled \"left breast cancer, **NAME[AAA] XXXXXX\" is an ovoid gray to yellow piece of breast tissue with an attached gray skin ellipse.  The specimen weighs 23.0 gm and measures 5.5 cm from medial to lateral x 4.2 cm superior to inferior x 2.1 cm from anterior to deep.  The skin appears grossly unremarkable and measures 3.3 x 0.6 x 0.3 cm.  There is a short suture at the superior margin, a long suture at the lateral margin and a double suture at the deep margin.  The specimen is differentially inked: orange = anterior, black = deep, green = superior, blue = inferior, red = medial and yellow = lateral.  The specimen was removed from the patient at 1304 hours and immediately placed in formalin resulting in total formalin fixation time of 6 hours.  Sectioning reveals a firm ill-defined gray mass within the center of the specimen that measures 1.5 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm and is situated 0.5 cm from the closest deep margin, approximately 1.0 cm from the closest superior margin, 1.2 cm from the closest inferior margin and not in proximity to any other surface margins.

The\nB-cells do not co-express cyclin D1, BCL2 or CD43.  The proliferation rate\nis low and estimated at less than 10% on Ki-67 immunostain and the\nbackground plasma cells are polytypic on in situ hybridization for\nimmunoglobulin kappa and lambda light chains.  In addition, EBER stain\nshows no EBV-infected cells.  The overall morphologic and\nimmunohistochemical findings are not supportive of a diagnosis of lymphoma.\nHowever, the infiltrate is considered atypical given the slight\npredominance of B-cells. Compared to the previous dural biopsy from 2009\n(XXXXX), there are slightly fewer CD20-positive B-cells in the\ncurrent specimen.

The tumor measures 5.5 cm. in maximum dimension. It has rolled borders and central ulceration. Sections of the tumor show no obvious extension into the mesenteric adipose. On the antimesenteric surface there is focal possible minimal extension into adherent adipose tissue. There are also multiple additional polyps ranging in size from 0.2 to 1.5 cm. in diameter. They are all located at least 5 cm. from the proximal and distal margins. The mesentery measures up to 8 cm. in length. The mesenteric margin is greater than 10 cm. from the tumor. There is a grossly positive node at the mesenteric margin. All identified lymph nodes are submitted.   There is also a separate segment of small bowel in the specimen container measuring up to 4 cm. in length x 2 cm. in diameter. There are staple lines at either end. They are removed. The specimen is lined by  homogenous folded light tan mucosa. There is very little mesentery attached to the specimen. Sections show no vascular lesions or lymphadenopathy.

Sessile serrated polyp.  See microscopic description. (B)  Colon, \"50-55 cm.\", endoscopic biopsy:  Ulcerated, detached fragments of colonic mucosa with at least high grade dysplasia/carcinoma in-situ (see    microscopic description).\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: The following specimens are received in prefilled formalin containers: (A) Labeled \"cecal polyp\" are multiple pieces of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 0.2 up to 0.6 cm. in greatest dimension.  Entirely submitted. (B) Labeled \"ulcerative segment of colon, 50-55 cm. biopsy\" are multiple pieces of tan-pink soft tissue measuring 0.1 up to 0.5 cm. in greatest dimension.  Entirely submitted./AKC,SXH\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: (A)  Histologic sections demonstrate multiple fragments of colonic mucosa. Some of the fragments show hyperchromasia and stratification consistent with a tubular adenoma.  Other fragments show serrated glands.  No high-grade dysplasia identified. (B)  Histologic sections demonstrate fragments of colonic mucosa. Some of the fragments are essentially ulcerated with underlying granulation tissue. Adjacent to these ulcerative areas is adenomatous colonic mucosa with crowded glands and marked epithelial atypia, consistent with at least high grade dysplasia/carcinoma in-situ.  The depth of invasion cannot be determined due to the ulceration and superficial nature of the biopsy and invasion can't be excluded.  As such, additional evaluation is recommended.\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:  (A) CECAL POLYP                    (B) COLON BIOPSY, ULCERATIVE SEGMENT AT 50-55 CM\n"

The\nPCR-amplified products are analyzed by pyrosequencing using one or more\nsequencing reactions. This assay can detect any mutation type in codons 12\nand 13 at a sensitivity of 5% for any mutation present. The sensitivity is\nconfirmed by external 5% sensitivity and wild-type controls in every run.\n\nRef: Ogino,S et al. Sensitive Sequencing Method for KRAS Mutation Detection\nby Pyrosequencing.  J. Mol. Diag. (2005), 7 (3): 413-421.\n\nDNA is extracted from diagnostic paraffin-embedded tissue sections\nfollowing microdissection and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nusing primers flanking codon 600 of the BRAF gene. The PCR-amplified\nproducts are analyzed by pyrosequencing of codons 599-601. This assay has a\nsensitivity of 10% for single point mutations and can detect any mutation\ntype in codon 600.\n\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident. These studies are performed under a\ndiagnostic PCR license from **INSTITUTION. This test was\ndeveloped and validated by XXXXX.   The U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration has not approved this test.  The results are\nintended to be correlated with other clinical information for patient\nmanagement rather than as a sole means of diagnosis.  XXXXX is authorized\nto perform high complexity testing as described by the Clinical Laboratory\nImprovement Amendments.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[ZZZ YYY], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[May 29 2012] 03:38 PM\nRESULTS:\n     Negative for mutations in codons 12 or 13 of KRAS\n     Positive for BRAF V600E mutation, see diagnostic interpretation\n\nDIAGNOSTIC INTERPRETATION:\nNo mutations are detected in codons 12 or 13 of the KRAS gene. However, a\nGTG>GAG mutation in codon 600 of the BRAF gene is identified. The detection\nof this mutation may assist in refining prognostic expectations in\ncolorectal carcinoma. Some recent data suggest relatively poor response to\nanti-EGFR antibody therapy in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic\ncolorectal carcinoma with co-existing BRAF V600E mutation. Clinical\ncorrelation is recommended. This assay is not designed to detect other rare\nmutations in the KRAS or BRAF genes.\nSPECIMEN:\n\nReferral ID #: XXXXX\nSpecimen Type: PET - COLON, HEPATIC FLEXURE MASS\n"

The background contains red blood cells and columnar respiratory epithelial cells. The atypical cells present in the slides stained for quick stain interpretation are consistent with neoplastic cells upon review of the Papanicolaou stained slides. The Thin prep concentrated smear also contains neoplastic cells with vesicular nuclei containing clumped chromatin and small nucleoli as well as moderate amounts of cytoplasm. The cell block contains a few groups of neoplastic cells as well. \nB. These smears contain red blood cells, peripheral blood white cells and a few columnar respiratory epithelial cells.

No specific origin is suggested by an      immunophenotype performed at **INSTITUTION Arizona.  The overall immunomorphology does not      support a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma (polyclonal CEA positive). **INITIALS COMMENT:  The diagnosis above was rendered by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ M. YYY] at **NAME[XXX] Clinic in Scottsdale Arizona.  Report will scanned into PIM and also Medical Records.  Dr. **NAME[WWW] has discussed this diagnosis with Dr. **NAME[VVV] on **DATE[Jan 17 12]. **INITIALS PROVISIONAL ADDENDUM COMMENT:  The immunostains are inconclusive. The case will be sent for outside consultation prior to issuing a final report. I have discussed this with **NAME[TTT] in Dr. **NAME[UUU]'s office on **DATE[Jan 10 12]. **INITIALS  RIGHT PLEURAL TISSUES (#s 1 AND 2):      Malignant neoplasm.  Further characterization pending immunostains. **INITIALS\nGross Description Specimen 1 received fresh for frozen section labeled pleural tissue is a 2.0 x 1.5 x 0.5cm aggregate of tan/pink soft tissue which is submitted entirely for frozen section, now resubmitted in cassette 1. Specimen 2 received in formalin labeled right pleural tissue are a few pieces of tan/pink soft tissue aggregating 2.0 x 1.8 x 0.3cm which are submitted in toto in cassette 2.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections show nests of malignant cells within a reactive fibrotic background with some chronic inflammation.  Rare groups are seen in the original frozen section block.  **INITIALS ADDITIONAL MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: All controls stain appropriately including external positive, internal negative and external negative controls as required.  The CK7 is strongly positive in the tumor cells while the CK20, TTF, and Napsin are all negative. The calretinin shows positive staining the background spindle cell component but also appears to show some weak cytoplasmic staining in the tumor cells. For this reason, the findings are somewhat inconclusive.  **INITIALS **INSTITUTION CONSULTATION: The tumor cells are strongly positive for polyclonal CEA and express cytokeratin 5/6.  EMA is diffusely positive within the tumor cytoplasm.  These immunohistochemical findings support a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma to pleura.  TTF-1 and CD15 are negative in the tumor cells, as are calretinin, WT-1, and D2-40.  Pancytokeratin nicely outlines the infiltrative malignant tumor cells.  **INITIALS\nAmendments: Amended:  **DATE[Jan 10 2012] by **NAME[SSS RRR] Reason: Immunohistochemical Results      Previous Signout Date:  **DATE[Jan 8 2012] Amended:  **DATE[Jan 17 2012] by Ruthanne Walker Reason: OUTSIDE CONSULTATION RESULTS      Previous Signout Date:  **DATE[Jan 10 2012] Electronically Signed Out By **NAME[WWW, CCC M].

These are submitted uncut as 1. 2: Received in formalin labeled \"transverse colon\" is a 22 cm long unopened segment of large intestine which includes a moderate amount of attached mesentery and a 13.1 x 11.3 x 1.1 cm aggregate of contiguous omentum.  The omentum shows a few remnants of adhesions near one edge.  It is otherwise unremarkable.  When the bowel segment is opened, a 3.7 x 3.0 x 0.9 cm neoplastic appearing lesion is identified paracentral within the colonic segment 8.5 cm from the closest surgical margin.  This lesion involves 75% of the circumference of the bowel at this point.  The lesion involves the full thickness of the bowel wall and superficially invades the adjacent soft tissues.  The lesion is 5 cm from the sutured mesenteric apex soft tissue margin.  Although the margin is grossly uninvolved, there is a 1.7 cm suspicious appearing lymph node adjacent to the margin.  Sectioning of the remainder of the mesentery shows additional lymph nodes to 1.3 cm in greatest dimension.  The proximal and distal bowel margins are grossly uninvolved.  The bowel between the lesion and the closest margin shows a 0.3 cm sessile polyp.  This is 3.5 cm from the margin and the only additional lesion seen.

TUMOR NECROSIS IS NOTED. PLEASE SEE COMMENT.  PATHOLOGIST's COMMENTS  IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY REPORT  Using appropriate positive and negative controls, sections from the right lung biopsy are submitted for immunoreactive thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), p63, cytokeratin 5/6, cytokeratin 7, and CAM5.2 via an immunohistochemical technique.  Most tumor cells stain strongly positive for cytokeratin 5/6.  Several tumor cells stain moderate to strongly positive for p63.  Tumor cells are negative for TTF-1 and cytokeratin 7.  CAM5.2 stain is non contributory.  All external controls react appropriately.  INTERPRETATION:  This staining pattern is most supportive of a squamous cell carcinoma.  Reviewed for QA (LK). \nGROSS DESCRIPTION  Received in formalin designated \\\"right lung biopsy\\\" are multiple minute fragments of pale tan to white soft tissue measuring up to 0.3 cm in length.

(Please see comment.)\n\nComment:\nNote is made of the provided clinical information and the patient's previous history of invasive mammary ductal carcinoma and prostate carcinoma. The patient's previous specimens (N08 693, S08 243 and S08 8378) are reviewed for morphologic comparison. Immunohistochemical stains are performed on the cellblock of the current fine needle aspiration specimen of the left lung and show the following results in the tumor cells: strong diffuse positivity for TTF1 and NapsinA; negative for ER, mammaglobin, GCDFP, PSA and PSAP. This immunohistochemical profile, in conjunction with the morphology, is consistent with a primary lung adenocarcinoma. Clinical and imaging correlation is recommended.\n\nThis case was reviewed at the daily intradepartmental conference for consensus diagnosis on **DATE[Jun 5 2013]. Results given to Dr. **NAME[M. ZZZ] via phone by Dr. **NAME[M. YYY] on **DATE[Jun 5 2013].\n\n\nGrossDescription:\nReceived:  30cc blood tinged cytolyt for ThinPrep and Cell Block; 3 Air-Dried Smears, 3 Fixed Smears.\nSpecimen examined in Radiology suite with rapid cytologic stain: found to have sufficient cellular material for pathologic examination.\nA: Lung Left, Fine Needle Aspiration\n"

Though the largest studies have used 10% as a \n  threshold for positivity, others have recommended a cutoff as low as 1%. \n\nHER-2/neu\n  Analysis is performed using Chromavision Automated Cellular Imaging System (ACIS) on formalin-fixed paraffin-\n  embedded section stained by immunohistochemical on the Ventana Benchmark XT automated stainer using HER-2/neu \n  (4B5)  Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody.\n\n  Slides were reviewed by an in-house pathologist and deemed adequate for analysis.  All controls (negative, positive, and \n  equivocal) were appropriate.\n\n  The results obtained from the ChromaVision ACIS correspond to the ASCO/CAP scoring criteria in the following \n  manner, as determined by in-house studies:\n\n  ChromaVision:         ASCO/CAP \n  Result:          Score:\n\n  Less than 1.5         0       (No staining)\n\n  Less than 1.5         1+        (Weak, incomplete membrane staining)\n\n  1.5 to 3.4              2+        (Complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak in \n                       intensity, but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least 10% of the \n                       cells, or intense complete membrane staining in less than 30% of invasive \n                       tumor cells)\n\n  Greater than 3.4       3+       (Uniform, intense membrane staining in greater or lesser than 30% \n                       invasive tumor cells)\n\n  A ChromaVision ACIS score of 1.5 to 3.4 is reflexed to Her-2/neu testing by FISH methods, unless otherwise \n  specified.  This is in accordance with CAP recommendations (Strategic Science I Meeting, **DATE[May 2003], **PLACE, \n  IL).\n\n  Per the 2007 joint guidelines of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American \n  Pathologists (CAP) on HER2 testing in breast cancer, specimens should be fixed in 10% neutral buffered \n  formalin for intervals ranging from 6 hours to no more than 48 hours.  Prolonged fixation, for example more than \n  48 hours, may result in false-negative results.  Fixation times for needle biopsies have not been addressed.  \n  \nReferences:\n  1.

The immunohistochemistry results are by report\nonly (not reviewed).\nAdditional immunohistochemistry staining for estrogen and progesterone\nreceptor expression was performed on the smaller lesion (0.5 cm, ductal\nNOS) with the following results:  ER 100% tumor cells positive, PR 100%\ntumor cells positive.  Immunohistochemistry for Her-2/neu is pending and\nthe results will be reported in an addendum.\n\n<COMMENT>\nThe excision contains two morphologically discrete foci of infiltrating\ncarcinoma.  One focus (1.3 cm) is associated with the prior biopsy site\nand shows morphologic features of micropapillary carcinoma. The second\nfocus (0.4 cm) is located more laterally within the specimen, closely\nassociated with low grade in-situ carcinoma, and shows morphologic\nfeatures most closely resembling ductal carcinoma, NOS.  Although both\nfoci show a similar ER/PR expression profile, the distinct morphologic\nprofiles favors two separate primaries over intramammary spread.\n\nThe micropapillary carcinoma shows multifocal lymphatic involvement.\nThe invasive carcinoma that is close to the anterior and superior\nmargins is micropapillary type and appears to be related to lymphatic\nspread.\n\n<CLINICAL INFO>\nRight breast cancer.

Received fresh, labeled \"**NAME[AAA BBB]\" and designated \"right\nbreast lumpectomy\", is an oriented breast biopsy, 6.5 cm lateral to\nmedial, 5.5 cm anterior to deep, and 3 cm superior to inferior. There is\na short suture attached to one surface designating the \"superior margin\"\nand a long stitch attached to one edge designates the \"lateral margin\".\nThe specimen is inked as follows: superior orange, inferior green,\nlateral yellow, medial red, anterior blue and deep black. The specimen\nis serially sectioned lateral to medial into fifteen slices. There is a\nprevious needle biopsy site within slices 13 and 14, which consists of a\n0.5 cm cavity filled with soft brown material. The biopsy site grossly\nextends to within less than 0.1 cm of the anterior margin, 0.5 cm of the\nsuperior margin, 0.4 cm of the medial margin, and is at least 1 cm from\nall other margins. The remaining specimen consists of a homogeneous\nadipose tissue. No tumors or additional biopsy sites are grossly\nidentified. Representative material is submitted as follows:\nBlock Key:\nD1.

VVV], M.D. (select slides from specimen D).\n\n<ADDENDUM> #1\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY STUDY:\nImmunohistochemistry studies for detection of the HER2 oncogene product\n(using **INSTITUTION. Pathway Anti-HER2 rabbit monoclonal\nantibody, clone 4B5) are carried out on formalin-fixed,\nparaffin-embedded tissue sections.  Positive and negative controls show\nappropriate reactivity. Interpretation of Ventana Pathway for HER2\nimmunostain is performed according to guidelines recommended by ASCO/CAP\nin 2007 (see comment below).  Results are as follows:\nBlock D3\n\nAntibody  Result    Comment\nHER2 0    Negative for overexpression\n\nImpression:\nInterpreted by:  **NAME[YYY M XXX] M.D.\nComment:\n\n1.  The guideline recommendations by ASCO/CAP in 2007 is as follows:  A\nscore of 3+ (positive HER2 test) is defined by uniform intense membrane\nstaining in >30% of tumor cells.  A score of 2+ (equivocal HER2 test) is\ndefined by complete membrane staining that is either nonuniform or weak\nin intensity but with obvious circumferential distribution in at least\n10% of tumor cells, or less commonly, intense complete membrane staining\nbut in only 30% or fewer tumor cells.  A score of 0 or 1+ (negative HER2\ntest) is defined by no or weak and incomplete membrane staining in any\nproportion of tumor cells.\n2.  The correlation between HER2 protein overexpression by\nimmunohistochemistry and HER2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in\nsitu hybridization (FISH) is not 100%.  Rare cases interpreted as\nnegative (0 and 1+) for HER2 protein overexpression may demonstrate low\nlevel HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH.  Approximately 10-20% of\ncases interpreted as 2+ may show gene amplification by FISH, while the\nvast majority of cases, if not all, interpreted as 3+ show gene\namplification by FISH.  Therefore, additional testing for HER2/neu gene\namplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) may be\nconsidered on individual cases, if clinically warranted.  Reflexive\ntesting for HER2/neu gene amplification by FISH will be performed on all\ncases interpreted as 2+ (equivocal for protein overexpression) by\nimmunohistochemistry.

Last specimen received was t(9;22) BCR-ABL fusion gene\nnegative on **DATE[Jun 28 2011] (***path number ***\nCASE: ***path number ***\nPATIENT: **NAME[AAA BBB]\nASSAY SUMMARY:\nQuantitative real-time PCR analysis for BCR-ABL transcripts arising from\nthe t(9;22)(q34;q11) is performed on total RNA isolated from fresh blood.\nThe specificity of the reaction is established using specific\noligonucleotide primers and fluorescent probes, which together span the\nunique junctional regions of the BCR-ABL fusions. The relative quantitative\nabundance of BCR-ABL transcripts in patient sample is determined from a\nstandard curve of known serially diluted BCR-ABL transcripts and is\nexpressed as a normalized ratio of BCR-ABL to endogenous ABL transcripts to\ncorrect for variations in RNA input and sample amplification quality (see\nreference below). The sensitivity of this assay has been determined to be\napproximately 10 BCR-ABL transcripts per microgram of total RNA. This assay\nis intended for the diagnostic detection and subsequent monitoring of\npatients with t(9;22)(q34;q11). The assay will not detect rare variant\nforms of BCR-ABL arising from different breakpoint loci in BCR and ABL,\nwhich have been described in some patients with chronic myeloproliferative\ndisorders (e.g. chronic neutrophilic leukemia). Integrity of RNA is\nassessed by visualizing the 18S and 28S rRNA with capillary\nelectrophoresis.\n\nRef: Gabert J, et al.

Container designation: \"right colon\" --  Received fresh is a segment\nof bowel comprised of 15 cm large bowel including cecum and 15 cm of small\nbowel and a 7.6 cm attached appendix. A cecal mass can be palpated from the\nexternal surface and has an ill-defined puckered area adjacent to the\nattachment of the appendix.  This external surface is inked blue.  The\nproximal surgical margin is inked green and the distal surgical margin is\ninked black.  The specimen is opened revealing a 7.0 x 5.5 x 2.2 cm\nlobulated tan-pink somewhat friable mass in the cecum and 1.0 cm from the\nileocecal valve and entirely covering the appendiceal lumen (no appendiceal\nlumen identified). The appendiceal lumen is probed to the tumor mass and\nthe underlying surface of the tumor mass does not appear to involve the\nappendix. The mass lesion has a maximal depth of 1.1 cm and does not\ngrossly involve the serosal surface. The mass is 15 cm from the distal\nsurgical margin and 11 cm from the proximal surgical margin. The large\nbowel mucosa is wrinkled, glistening and tan without other grossly\nidentifiable masses or polyps.  The small bowel mucosa is wrinkled\nglistening tan without grossly identifiable masses or polyps.  The\nappendiceal lumen is glistening tan, wrinkled and slightly hemorrhagic\nwithout gross perforation or fibrinopurulent exudate present.\nRepresentative sections are submitted as follows: A1   representative\nproximal margin, A2   representative distal margin, A3   ileal colic stump\n(marked with stitch), A4   representative colon, A5   representative small\nbowel, A6   appendix, A7-A13   representative sections of tumor (A7\nrepresentative tumor adjacent to appendix, A8   representative mass to\nileocecal valve, A9-A11   representative mass to deepest invasive\nareas/closest serosa, full thickness), A14-A29   lymph nodes submitted in\ntheir entirety except where differentially inked and noted as follows:\nA19-A21   each contain one lymph node sectioned, A22   one lymph node\nbisected (unlinked) with other lymph nodes in their entirety (inked blue),\nA24   one lymph node bisected (inked blue) and lymph nodes in their\nentirety (uninked), A25   two lymph nodes each bisected (one inked blue,\nthe other black), A26   one lymph node sectioned, A28   one lymph node\nsectioned, A29   one lymph node sectioned.\n\n(Gross description dictated by: **NAME[ZZZ YYY], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n\n**NAME[XXX WWW], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Jun 28 2012] 02:37 PM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

The\nPCR-amplified products are analyzed by pyrosequencing using one or more\nsequencing reactions. This assay can detect any mutation type in codons 12\nand 13 at a sensitivity of 5% for any mutation present. The sensitivity is\nconfirmed by external 5% sensitivity and wild-type controls in every run.\n\nRef: Ogino,S et al. Sensitive Sequencing Method for KRAS Mutation Detection\nby Pyrosequencing.  J. Mol. Diag. (2005), 7 (3): 413-421.\n\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident. These studies are performed under a\ndiagnostic PCR license from **INSTITUTION. This test was\ndeveloped and validated by XXXXX.   The U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration has not approved this test.  The results are\nintended to be correlated with other clinical information for patient\nmanagement rather than as a sole means of diagnosis.

This finding indicates\nthat anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody therapy may not\nbe efficacious for this patient (2). These results should be interpreted in\nconjunction with clinical data.\n\nRef: Allegra CJ et al.

The patient is identified by ID tags present on the left wrist which are labeled with the patient\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd's name and medical record number and birth date.  The autopsy permission is limited to recovery of pulmonary embolus, specifically at the family\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd's request.  There is a 2.5 x 0.2cm well healed scar present subjacent to the clavicle along the midline.  There is a 2.0 x 0.3cm well healed scar present on the right lateral aspect of the thorax.  There is 9.0 x 0.3cm well healed scar present on the lower abdomen which is vertical and subjacent to the umbilicus to the pelvis.  There is a 0.3 x 0.3cm ecchymosis present on the right posterior thorax, ? area of thoracentesis.  The patient has a red wrist band labelled allergies and Metronidazole.  There is a green wrist band superior to the previously mentioned red wrist band which is labeled with the following: **WEB-LOC CAT #AT#62476 A0298. There is an IV present in the right forearm.  The skin is otherwise unremarkable.  His hair is gray to black and shows a normal distribution.  The irises are brown and the pupils are equal at 0.5cm.  The mouth, teeth, neck, chest and abdominal contours are grossly unremarkable.  The genitalia is that of a normal adult male.  Configuration of the extremities and the dorsum are unremarkable.  \n\nBody Cavities:\n  A Y shaped incision is made using non sterile technique.  The mediastinum is in the midline.  The thymus is not grossly identified in the anterior mediastinal fat.  The left pleural surface is smooth, shiny and transparent.  The right pleural surface is entirely indurated.  The indurated tissue extends to the chest plate and surrounding ribs.  The pericardial sac is smooth and contains approximately 10.0cc of serous fluid.  The pulmonary trunk is opened in situ.  A 21.5 x 1.0 x 1.0cm mass of saddle embolus is present within the pulmonary arteries bilaterally.  The left aspect of the embolus measures 13.0 x 1.0 x 1.0cm and the right aspect of the embolus measures 8.5 x 1.0 x 1.0cm and completely occluded the lumen of the right and left pulmonary arteries.  The pulmonary embolus is removed and this completed the extent of the autopsy.\nMicroscopicDescription:\nBlood Clot:  Sections from the right and left pulmonary artery embolus show organizing thrombi with lines of Zahn, consistent with thromboembolus (saddle embolus).\n1: Autopsy Routine\n"

In specimen #2, left breast, 12:30, without calcifications, needle core biopsy specimen, intraductal carcinoma (ductal carcinoma in situ) involves an estimated two (2) needle core biopsy tissue cores in the sections examined.  \n\n  Intraductal carcinoma (ductal carcinoma in situ) has solid and comedo carcinoma architectural patterns and a nuclear grade ranging from grade 2 of 3 to grade 3 of 3, and would be considered an intermediate to high grade intraductal carcinoma (ductal carcinoma in situ).  Focal microcalcifications are associated with the intraductal carcinoma (ductal carcinoma in situ) in specimen #1.  \n\n  No invasive carcinoma is identified in any portion of the present needle core biopsy specimen of the left breast at 12:30 in any section examined.; \n\n  Immunohistochemical stains for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor (quantitative) will be performed on this specimen (on block 1A) and the results will be reported separately in an addendum.\nGrossDescription:\n  Container 1:  Received in formalin labeled A left breast tissue with calcifications at 12:30 are three yellow to white cores of soft tissue ranging from 2.0 x 0.2cm to 2.7 x 0.2cm, which are submitted in toto as 1A.\n\n  Container 2:  Received in formalin labeled B left breast tissue without calcifications at 12:30 are eight yellow to white cores of soft tissue ranging from 0.4 x 0.2cm to 1.8 x 0.2cm, which are submitted in toto as 2A and 2B.\n\n  Fixation of specimen reviewed and assured to be 6 to 48 hours. \nCH:lefb **DATE[Feb 15 2013].\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  Slides reviewed.\n1: Left breast core biopsy2: Left breast core biopsy\nAddendumComment:\nER/PR (QUANTITATIVE INTERPRETATION)\nEstrogen and Progesterone Receptor analysis are performed on formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue (Block 1A) using immunohistochemical techniques.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY TECHNICAL INFORMATION: \nDeparaffinized sections of tissue are incubated with the following panel of monoclonal antibodies, along with appropriate positive controls.  Localization is via a biotin free, EnVision Flex + immunoperoxidase system with pretreatment (heat induced epitope retrieval) according to laboratory optimization for each antibody.  The control slides for each test are reviewed for appropriate positive and negative reactivity and found to be satisfactory.\n\nSUMMATION OF FINDINGS: \nThe Estrogen Receptor (VECTOR CLONE 6F11) is positive in 80% to 90% of the tumor cells showing 1 to 2+ staining intensity.  The Progesterone Receptor (DAKO Clone PgR 636) is positive in 70% to 80% of the tumor cells showing 1 to 3+ staining intensity.\n\nNOTE:   Positive Estrogen Receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.  Positive Progesterone receptor is defined as positive staining of greater than or equal to 1% of tumor cells.\n\nImmunohistochemical estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor test results are reported using the ASCO CAP scoring criteria.  If positive, staining intensity may be reported numerically 1, 2, 3+ or descriptively as weak, moderate or strong. \n\nPQRS CODE: 3394F\n\n\n"

Immunohistochemical staining shows diffusely positive staining of these cells with CD56, and weak staining with cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and chromogranin.  Staining is negative with TTF-1 and synaptophysin.  The findings are suspicious for, but not diagnostic of small cell undifferentiated carcinoma.\nGrossDescription:\nReceived:  A) 3 ml of cloudy red fluid.\n       B) 2 smears in 95% reagent alcohol for Pap stain.\n      1 cytobrush tip with tissue fragments in formalin solution.\nPrepared:  A) 1 ThinPrep slide for Pap stain, treated with Sputasol and CytoLyt x1.\n      Insufficient material for a cell block.\nSubmitted:  B)  10 tissue fragments measuring up to 2 mm in length for a cell block.\nA: RUL BRONCHIAL WASHING CYTOLOGY\nB: RUL BRONCHIAL BRUSHING/TIP CYTOLOGY\n"

The specimen is 5.0 cm superior to inferior, 5.5 cm medial to lateral and 2.2 cm anterior to posterior.  A double short suture marks the anterior margin, a single short suture the superior margin, and a single long suture the lateral margin.  The localization needle appears to enter the specimen at the inferior anterior portion.  The anterior lateral quadrant of the specimen is marked with blue ink, the anterior medial quadrant with yellow ink, and posterior half of the specimen with black ink.  The accompanying specimen x-ray shows a possible surgical metal clip overlying the 2D region of the grid adjacent to the localization needle tip.  In the touch specimen, there is a 1.0 x 0.7 x 0.7 cm possible tumor mass extending to within 2 mm of the anterior margin at the junction of blue and yellow ink.  The remaining margins appear well clear.  The tumor tends toward the medial anterior half of the specimen.  The medial margin is approximately 1 cm from tumor.  Submitted sections include: Closest medial margin  1A, B Tumor with closest anterior margin, from medial to lateral  1C, D Lateral margin  1E, F Superior margin  1G, H Deep margin  1I, J Inferior margin  1K, L Random breast tissue away from mass  1M, N 2: In the second container in the fresh state designated \"left sentinel node #1\" is a 2.0 x 1.4 x 0.9 cm ovoid gray structure consistent with a single lymph node.

The right colon measures 26 cm in length x approximately 3.5 cm in average diameter with the cecum measuring approximately 8 cm in diameter. The terminal ileum measures 7.5 cm in length, 3 cm in diameter. At the approximate mid portion of the right colon is a fungating ulcerating tumorous mass measuring 3.2 x 4.1 cm.  It is approximately 12.5 cm from the colonic margin and 10.5 cm from the ileocecal valve. The closest radial mesenteric margin to tumor measures 6.2 cm. On sectioning the tumor it is pasty yellow and necrotic extending from the submuscular fat. Maximal tumor thickness is 1.2 cm. The distal colonic mucosa demonstrates unremarkable rugosal folds while the more proximal segment including cecum is leathery and indurated with loss of mucosal folds. At this portion the maximal circumference of the bowel is 14.5 cm. The appendix is purplish red measuring 5 x 0.6 cm. On sectioning, the appendiceal wall is indurated as well. The external surface of the bowel is notable for areas of adhesion formation around the terminal ileum and cecum with areas of hemorrhagic discoloration, however, no definitive evidence of peritonitis or perforation is identified (history of free air and a tiny perforation at the time of surgery is noted. The terminal ileum is patent with soft yellow stool. No additional mucosal lesions are identified. Upon separating the mesenteric and omental fat from the main specimen, a few narrow necked diverticula are identified.  The adipose tissue is serially sectioned and a few pinkish lymph nodes are found ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 cm. The fat is post fixed in alcohol with additional node search to follow.  Summary of sections: colonic margin A1, ileal margin A2, sections of tumor A3-A6, indurated cecum and proximal ascending colon A7, appendix A8, adhesions in ileum and diverticulum A9, lymph nodes A10. Additional possible lymph nodes are submitted in A11-A13.  ksl/**DATE[Feb 19 2012] **NAME[M.

COMMENT:      This case was discussed with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ] by Dr. **NAME[YYY] on **DATE[Dec 13 11]. **INITIALS\nGross Description Received in formalin labeled right breast mass is a 6 x 3.5 x 2 cm in which wire indicates the inferior lateral margin and suture marks the superficial margin. Serial sectioning reveals fibrous breast tissue with multiple cystic spaces containing dense white crystalline material. This is located in the superomedial aspect of the specimen. The area of cyst formation and fibrosis with crystalline material is approximately 2 cm in diameter. The remaining tissue is unremarkable.  Summary of sections: A-E  fibrous and cystic area; F-G  random breast sections. Additional sections of tissue are submitted in blocks H-L on **DATE[Dec 12 11]. This is the entire specimen except for a few miscellaneous small bits of fat.  NOTE: The crystalline material could not be sectioned and is not submitted for histologic review. **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description The tissue shows several foci of intraductal carcinoma scattered throughout the entire length of the specimen. This is evenly distributed between high-grade ductal carcinoma in-situ and low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ. There are also numerous areas of atypical lobular hyperplasia and scattered focal areas that meet criteria for lobular carcinoma in situ. There is no invasive malignancy noted in the material. The high grade intraductal carcinoma does approach to within 0.2 mm of margin in one area, the low grade DCIS in a few other areas.  The cystic areas described grossly appear to be previous needle biopsy site. ADDITIONAL MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: This tumor shows POSITIVE nuclear staining for Estrogen Receptor (over 40% of tumor nuclei) and POSITIVE staining for Progesterone Receptor (over 40% of tumor nuclei). All controls stain appropriately including external positive, internal negative and external negative controls as required.  COMMENT: 1% or greater numbers of nuclei staining of any intensity is considered a positive test in our laboratory. ER clone Ventana SPI, PR clone IE2, IVD approved immunohistochemical stains on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue.

A biopsy performed the day before this procedure (***PATH-NUMBER[1]) has shown adenocarcinoma.  \n\n<HISTOLOGY COMMENT>\n\n\n\n<GROSS>\nThe specimen is labeled \"left colon\" and is received in formalin. It consists of a previously opened segment of colon measuring 21 cm in length. Roughly in the center the colon is constricted and there is a circumferential 4.5 cm (in circumference) x 3 cm sessile polypoid tan to red-tan tumor mass which protrudes up to 1.5 cm above the surrounding mucosa. In the center of the mass there is an 8 mm perforation and the attached mesentery also has an adjacent 2 cm perforation. The colon on one side of the mass is dilated and its mucosal folds are markedly edematous; this side will be treated as proximal. The tumor is 10 cm from the proximal margin and 8 cm from the distal margin. Distal to the tumor the circumference measures up to 4.5 cm and the mucosal folds are also slightly edematous. Located 1.5 cm from the distal margin there is an additional small 2.2 cm firm ulcerated tan mass. Four small 2-3 mm tan sessile polyps are present in the distal portion of the colon, located from 3 to 4 cm from the main tumor mass, and on the proximal side there are approximately eight white to tan 2 up to 10 mm sessile polyps. The mesentery measures up to 7 cm in width, and there is also a 9 x 7.5 cm piece of attached finely lobulated adipose tissue which may represent omentum. On sectioning, the tumor appears to infiltrate transmurally, and is possibly present on the serosal surface in the area of the perforation. In areas where the wall is intact tumor is located approximately 5 cm from the mesenteric margin. Representative sections are submitted. Cassette summary: A1 - adjacent to stapled proximal margin; A2 - adjacent to stapled distal margin; A3 - entire small ulcerated mass near distal margin; A4 - polyps in distal portion of colon; A5  A6 - polyps in proximal portion of colon; A7 - tumor adjacent to perforation (two sections, one on either side of the perforation); A8 - tumor, intact; A9  A10 - tumor in area of possible attached omentum, with possible serosal nodule in A10; A11 - tumor-uninvolved colon interface; A12 - three lymph node candidates. The remainder of the mesenteric and possible omental fat is removed from the specimen and fixed overnight in lymph node-clearing fixative. Multiple lymph node candidates are then dissected out of the fat and submitted as five lymph node candidates each in cassettes A13-A16.\n\n\n<COMMENT>\n\n\n<MICROSCOPIC>\nThe small ulcerated area near the distal margin shows no malignancy or adenomatous change and may represent a recent polypectomy site.\n\n<FINAL DX>\nLEFT COLON (RESECTION):  ADENOCARCINOMA, MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED.  THE TUMOR INVADES TRANSMURALLY AND IS PRESENT ON THE SEROSAL SURFACE.  NO METASTATIC CARCINOMA IDENTIFIED IN 9/9 REGIONAL LYMPH NODES BUT EXTRATUMORAL  DEPOSITS PRESENT.  PLEASE SEE SYNOPTIC REPORT/CHECKLIST SECTION.\n\n<ANCILLARY STUDIES>\n\n\n<EXTERNAL CONSULTATION>\n\n\n<INTRADEPARTMENTAL CONSULTATION>\n\n\n<NOTIFICATION>\nI discussed the preliminary findings with Dr. **NAME[ZZZ], **DATE[Nov 21 12].\n\n<PRELIM DX>\n\n\n<CHECKLIST>\nCANCER CHECKLIST:  COLON RESECTION  AJCC 7TH ED.  SPECIMEN:  Left colon. PROCEDURE:  Resection. SPECIMEN LENGTH:  21 cm. TUMOR SITE:  35-40 cm (sigmoid) per previous biopsy; splenic flexure per operative note in hospital information system. TUMOR SIZE:  4.5 cm in greatest dimension. MACROSCOPIC TUMOR PERFORATION:  Present. HISTOLOGIC TYPE:  Adenocarcinoma. HISTOLOGIC GRADE:  Low-grade. HISTOLOGIC FEATURES SUGGESTIVE OF MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY:  Mucinous component (but less than 50%  of the tumor); sessile serrated adenomas also noted.

XXX] M.D. Pathologist Electronically Signed **DATE[Aug 05 2012]\nGROSS DESCRIPTION: Specimen (A) Received in formalin designated 'colonic perforation/mass' is an unoriented segment of large bowel with attached mass of omental tissue with dense fibrous adhesions.  A gross perforation is identified along the length of the specimen.  As previously mentioned no orientation is provided.  The more narrow stapled end of the specimen measures up to 4.0 cm in diameter.  The opposing end is dilated and ischemic appearing measuring 9.0 cm in diameter.  The site of perforation is located 13.0 cm from the more viable smaller surgical margin.  The site of perforation measures up to 2.5 cm in single greatest dimension.  Surrounding necrosis and induration with potential mass extends to the radial margin of excision.  Representative sections from the smaller diameter surgical margin are submitted in cassette A1 and a larger diameter surgical margin submitted in cassette A2. Representative sections from the site of perforation are submitted in cassettes A3 and A4.  The relatively large segment of omental tissue measures 25.5 x 17.5 x 2.0 cm.  Sectioning through the omental tissue discloses no discrete mass.  A random representative section of apparent benign appearing omental tissue is submitted in cassette A5.  The specimen is opened in a longitudinal fashion disclosing a markedly edematous mucosal surface. There is a large perforated centrally necrotic and ulcerated colon mass identified. The circumferential mass measures approximately 8.5 cm in circumference by 6.0 cm by 7.5 cm.  The lesion extends deeply through the wall of the colon and extends to the site of perforation and adjacent radial margin. The tumor grossly extends into the pericolic fat. Tumor is submitted in cassettes A6-A9. No other discrete mass lesions are identified.  Careful palpation through the pericolic fat discloses indurated white nodules measuring up to 1.0 cm in single greatest dimension.  All potential lymph nodes are submitted in cassettes A10 through A17. Specimen (B) Received in formalin designated 'spleen' is a 246 gram spleen. There is some clotted blood adherent to the hilum of the spleen. There is focal disruption of the capsule near one edge of the specimen. The capsule disruption measures approximately 2.5 x 0.5 cm and is associated with subcapsular hemorrhage.  Representative sections from the hilum margin are submitted in cassette B3.  Representative sections from the small site of perforation are submitted in cassette B3. The spleen measures 12.0 x 9.3 x 3.0 cm.  Sectioning through the remainder portion of the spleen discloses homogenous maroon cut surface without hemorrhage, necrosis or discrete mass lesion.  Additional representative sections of the spleen are submitted in cassettes B3 and B4.  (**INITIALS)   Total Blocks Submitted: 21\nSPECIMEN(S): A COLON, SEGMENTAL SPECIMEN(S): B Spleen\n"

In\nconjunction with the clinical and laboratory findings, this is consistent\nwith a diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma. Although two trephine biopsies\nwere received, both were in fixative and flow and cytogenetics were unable\nto be performed. Due to the hypocellular nature of the clot and touch\npreparations, it is difficult to assess for dysplasia. If there is clinical\nconcern for an underlying lymphoid or myeloid process, repeat biopsy may be\nnecessary.\n\nThese results were discussed with Dr. **NAME[WWW] on **DATE[Dec 4 11].\nSPECIMEN:\n\nSpecimen:      Bone Marrow\nDate Collected: **DATE[Dec 02 2011]\nAspirate:      Performed\nBiopsy:   Unilateral\n"

Remainder of the thyroid shows benign colloid nodules and chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.  This diagnosis was rendered by Dr. **NAME[ZZZ YYY] at the **INSTITUTION. **INITIALS  PROVISIONAL DIAGNOSIS PENDING CONSULTATION: RIGHT THYROID LOBE AND ISTHMUS:      Multinodular thyroid with suspicious H rthle cell nodule and lymphocytic thyroiditis. DGD/mbc\nGross Description Received fresh for frozen section labeled right thyroid lobe and isthmus is a 7.3 gram, 4.5 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm intact hemithyroidectomy specimen. The capsule is inked black and sectioning reveals a few well-circumscribed tan/pink nodules ranging from 1.0 to 1.5 cm in greatest dimension. No invasion through the capsule or into the surrounding thyroid tissue is identified. A representative section is submitted for frozen section, now resubmitted in cassette A. The remaining thyroid is submitted in its entirety sequentially in cassettes B-G.  **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Sections of the thyroid show it to be comprised of multiple nodules with one of the nodules showing it to be comprised entirely of H rthle cells. There is an area suspicious for invasion of the capsule. The remainder of the thyroid nodules are separated by fibrous septae of variable thickness. Also noted are lymphoid germinal centers and a lymphocytic infiltrate scattered randomly through the gland. No evidence of parathyroid tissue is identified.  The case is forwarded to Dr.**NAME[ZZZ YYY] for consultation.

The specimen shows malignant cells morphologically consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains (CK7, TTF-1, CK5/6, p63, ER and mammoglobin) wit appropriately working controls were performed on the cellblock for qualitative impression. The malignant cells are positive for CK7 and TTF-1, they show focal faint staining for CK5/6 and p63 and they are negative for ER and mammoglobin. The immnohistochemical pattern is consistent with carcinoma from lung origin and it favors adenocarcinoma.  No evidence of metastatic breast carcinoma is present. PEER: KZK, MRJ Adequacy of specimen was checked using the Diff-Quick staining technique. Preliminary diagnosis of rapid evaluation:  Passes one through three were reviewed and showed marginally adequate material./SXH REVISED COMMENT:  Per request of Dr. **NAME[XXX WWW], after this case was signed-out, archived block(s) and slide(s) were pulled and reviewed by the pathologist, along with review of the corresponding pathology report, in order to select appropriate slide(s)/block(s) for the requested EGFR mutation and ALK translocation  molecular studies.

Last specimen received was t(9;22) BCR-ABL fusion gene\npositive with a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio of 0.0010 on **DATE[Aug 26 2010] (XXXXX).\nCASE: ***path number ***\nPATIENT: **NAME[AAA BBB]\nASSAY SUMMARY:\nQuantitative real-time PCR analysis for BCR-ABL transcripts arising from\nthe t(9;22)(q34;q11) is performed on total RNA isolated from fresh blood.\nThe specificity of the reaction is established using specific\noligonucleotide primers and fluorescent probes, which together span the\nunique junctional regions of the BCR-ABL fusions. The relative quantitative\nabundance of BCR-ABL transcripts in patient sample is determined from a\nstandard curve of known serially diluted BCR-ABL transcripts and is\nexpressed as a normalized ratio of BCR-ABL to endogenous ABL transcripts to\ncorrect for variations in RNA input and sample amplification quality (see\nreference below). The sensitivity of this assay has been determined to be\napproximately 10 BCR-ABL transcripts per microgram of total RNA. This assay\nis intended for the diagnostic detection and subsequent monitoring of\npatients with t(9;22)(q34;q11). The assay will not detect rare variant\nforms of BCR-ABL arising from different breakpoint loci in BCR and ABL,\nwhich have been described in some patients with chronic myeloproliferative\ndisorders (e.g. chronic neutrophilic leukemia). Integrity of RNA is\nassessed by visualizing the 18S and 28S rRNA with capillary\nelectrophoresis.\n\nRef: Gabert J, et al. Standardization and quality control studies of\n'real-time' quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction of\nfusion gene transcripts for residual disease detection in leukemia   A\nEurope Against Cancer Program. Leukemia 2003;**ID-NUM.\nRESULTS:\n          t(9;22) Quantitative PCR: Positive\n\nDIAGNOSTIC INTERPRETATION:\nBCR-ABL transcripts are detected with a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio of 0.00032.\nRatios >0.1 are consistent with high levels of BCR-ABL and are commonly\nseen at diagnosis in CML. A wide range of lower ratio levels can be seen\nfollowing therapy. In general, a sustained decrease in BCR-ABL level of\ngreater than 3 logs from baseline level correlates with therapeutic\nefficacy and remission status in response to imatinib therapy (see\nreference below). If the diagnostic level of BCR-ABL is not known, the\nfinding of significant serial decreases in BCR-ABL, a persistent but\nunchanging low-level of molecular positivity, or attainment of PCR\nnegativity may also be associated with favorable therapeutic status.\nConversely, failure to achieve a substantial decrease in BCR-ABL level with\nsequential monitoring, or the observation of serial increases in BCR-ABL\nlevels may indicate either non-responsiveness to therapy (e.g. imatinib\nresistance), or disease recurrence. RNA integrity has been verified by\nvisualizing the 18S and 28S rRNA. Correlation with clinical and therapeutic\nstatus is recommended.\n\n**NAME[ZZZ: YYY] TP, et al.

The lymph nodes are submitted as whole in cassettes A1 - A6.  \n\n(B)  Received fresh labeled \"right breast cancer\" is an oriented breast mass excision specimen measuring 7.5 x 7 x 2.5 cm.  The specimen is oriented with metallic margin markers, and is inked as follows:  cranial - blue, lateral - violet, medial - red, deep - black, caudal - green and skin - orange.  There is an anteriorly inserted localization wire that terminates within the caudal medial aspect of the specimen.  The guide wire tip shows breast tissue that is yellow and fatty.  No suspicious lesions or nodules surrounding the hook wire.  Within the middle aspect of the specimen on the anterior and lateral portion is a tan-white and firm gritty nodule (possible biopsy site) that measures 0.5 cm in greatest dimension.  It is within 0.3 cm under the violet inked lateral margin.  About 1.5 cm medially and anteriorly of the nodule is a 0.4 cm tan-white and firm nodule that appears to be grossly consistent with tumor.  It is within 0.8 cm of the nearest orange inked anterior surface, 1.5 cm from the violet inked lateral margin and more than 2 cm from the remaining margins.  Some areas surrounding the suspicious lesion are tan-pink and rubbery, suggestive of fibrocystic change.  All remaining breast tissue is yellow and fatty.  All margins appear grossly clear of the nodule.  Representative sections are submitted sequentially from caudal to cranial in fourteen cassettes.  Sections suspicious for cancer are submitted in cassettes B4 and B5.  \n\nAlso received is a yellow-pink and soft fatty tissue fragment measuring 3.3 x 2.5 x 1 cm.  The specimen is inked black.  All sections are yellow and fatty with some areas of hemorrhage.  No gross lesions or suspicious nodules noted.  Random sections of separate fatty tissue fragment in cassettes B13 and B14.  \n\nThe specimen was collected on **DATE[Apr 16 12] at 12:17 pm and placed in formalin at 1:00 pm, for a total fixation time of approximately \n6 hours.\n\n(C)  Received in formalin labeled \"re-excision lateral margin, right breast\" is an unoriented yellow-pink, red and soft, fibrofatty tissue fragment measuring 5.8 x 4.1 x 2.5 cm.  The specimen is inked black.  Sections reveal a predominantly yellow, fatty breast specimen with some areas of focal hemorrhage noted along the margins.  No sections reveal any suspicious nodules or residual tumor.

The serosa is tan to hemorrhagic and displays a centrally located area of black possible surgical tattooing, measuring 12.0 cm. from the terminal ileum margin and 11.0 cm. from the opposing margin. Measuring approximately 5.5 cm. proximal to the possible surgical tattooing there is an area of the colon and serosa that is firm, focally adhesed and puckered around the entire circumference of the specimen.  The attached yellow to focally hemorrhagic, lobulated adipose tissue is up to 10.0 cm. in thickness. The wall of the appendix averages 0.2 cm. in thickness and the lumen has a diameter that averages 0.3 cm. and is filled with tan-brown fecal material.  The bisected tip is tan and unremarkable.  No abnormalities are identified within the appendix.  The wall of the terminal ileum is 0.3 cm. in thickness and the mucosa is tan-pink with abundant folds and focal raised areas within the mucosa measuring 0.1 cm. in greatest dimension.  The ileo-cecal valve is tan-pink and unremarkable.  The wall of the colon averages 0.4 cm. in thickness and the mucosa is tan-pink with abundant folds and focal hemorrhagic areas.  The mucosa in the central aspect and previous area of possible surgical tattooing on the serosa displays black discoloration consistent with tattooing underlying the mucosa.  An irregular, indurated tan to hemorrhagic mass with central ulceration and markedly heaped-up borders is present and measures 7.0 x 6.3 x 1.2 cm.  The mass is circumferential, narrows the lumen to approximately 0.8 cm. and is present in the previously mentioned circumferential puckered firm area.  A small portion of the mass is grossly present towards the cecum and the majority of the mass is present in the ascending colon.  The mass measures 4.0 cm. from the terminal ileum margin and 17.0 cm. from the opposing margin.  The mass is located 2.0 cm. distal to the ileocecal valve. The serosa surrounding the mass is inked black and the radial margin is inked green.  The radial margin is confirmed with Dr. **NAME[VVV] and upon sectioning the mass, it is located 0.3 cm. from the closest portion of the mass.  The mass is tan-white and irregular on cut section and grossly extends through the wall into the adipose tissue.  The mass abuts areas of the inked serosa and possible extension through the serosa is possible, consistent with the previously mentioned puckering on the serosa.  The mass is up to 3.0 cm. in thickness on cut section. There are two tan-pink sessile polyps within the ascending colon measuring 0.4 x 0.2 x 0.1 cm. and 1.0 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm.  The sessile polyps measure 5.5 and 3.5 cm. (respectively) distal to the mass.  The sessile polyps come to within 9.0 and 12.0 cm. from the stapled margins and are both located within the area of black tattooing.  Dissection of the adipose tissue reveals nineteen tan-pink possible lymph nodes ranging from 0.3 x 0.2 x 0.2 cm. to 1.1 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm.  One of the possible lymph nodes is present abutting the mass.  One possible lymph node abuts the radial margin. An additional portion of bowel closed with two stapled margins is present within the container, measuring 8.0 cm. in length x 10.0 cm. in diameter.  The serosa is tan-pink and the attached yellow lobulated adipose tissue is up to 3.0 cm. in thickness.  The wall averages 0.4 cm. in thickness and the mucosa is tan-pink with abundant folds and numerous raised possible polypoid areas ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 cm. in greatest dimension and coming to within 0.3 and 2.0 cm. from the stapled margins.  Dissection of the adipose tissue attached to the additional portion of bowel reveals one tan-pink possible lymph node measuring 0.3 cm. in greatest dimension. Representative sections are submitted as follows: cassette \"1\" - terminal ileum margin; \"2\" - distal colon margin, enface; \"3\" - appendix; \"4\" - terminal ileum mucosa; \"5\" - ileocecal valve; \"6-7\" - one full thickness section of mass (bisected)including adjacent unremarkable mucosa, invasion into adipose tissue, and radial margin; \"8\" - mass to radial margin; \"9-11\" - mass to closest inked serosa; \"12\" - mass invading adipose tissue; \"13\" - mass surrounding one possible lymph node; \"14\" - larger sessile polyp; \"15\" - smaller sessile polyp and mucosa within tattooed area; \"16\" - unremarkable mucosa; \"17\" - one possible lymph node abutting radial margin (perpendicular); \"18\"- six possible lymph nodes; \"19\" - six possible lymph nodes; \"20\" - three possible lymph nodes; \"21\" - one possible lymph node, bisected; \"22\" - one possible lymph node, trisected; \"23\" - additional portion of small bowel margin, enface; \"24\" - opposing additional portion of small bowel margin, enface; \"25\" - unremarkable mucosa and possible lymph node of additional portion of small bowel./HAH,MRJ\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Sections of the grossly recognized tumor mass within the resected portion of the cecum and ascending colon display an invasive, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Some areas show a mucinous differentiation, but this is not a predominant feature.  The tumor extends through the entire thickness of the muscularis propria and penetrates the serosa with the ink being seen on neoplastic glands on the serosal surface (slice \"10\").  Vascular or perineural invasion were not appreciated.  One of eighteen mesenteric lymph nodes showed evidence of metastatic disease.  This node also displays extranodal extension (slide \"13\").  The tumor is located 3 mm. away from the radial margin. The distal and proximal margins are distanced from the tumor.  The additional grossly recognized polypoid mucosal region in the resected colon shows a hyperplastic polyp (slide \"15) and a tubular adenoma with a focus of high-grade dysplasia (slide \"14\").  The appendix did not show clinically significant histologic changes. The additional bowel segment histologically corresponds to a portion of small bowel.  It is without clinically significant histological alterations.\nTISSUE SUBMITTED:   RIGHT COLON, AND TERMINAL ILEUM\n"

The pleura is purple-tan, smooth,\nglistening and remarkable for a 2.5 x 1.5 cm yellow-tan glistening\nsubpleural plaque.  This plaque-like lesion comes to within 1.0 cm of the\nclosest parenchymal resection margin and is marked with silver nitrate.\nThe staple lines are removed and the underlying parenchyma is inked blue\nand the specimen is serially sectioned to demonstrate a moderately\ndelineated 2.6 x 1.8 x 1.7 cm mass lesion with homogenous white-tan\nglistening and focally hemorrhagic cut surfaces. This mass lesion abuts,\ndistends the pleura at the aforementioned plaque-like lesion and comes to\nwith 0.3 cm of the closest inked parenchymal margin.  The remaining,\nuninvolved lung parenchyma is brown-red, mottled, focally compressed but\notherwise grossly unremarkable.  Representative sections submitted in\nblocks A1-A5. \nB) Received in a container labeled with the patient's name and \"#2\"\nrequisition additionally stating \"right lower lobe wedge\" is a 2 gram\n(formalin weight) 4.8 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm wedge of lung with a 5.5 cm simple\nstaple line. The pleural is brown-tan, smooth, glistening and focally\nragged with membranous adhesions. No discrete lesions however are grossly\nnoted. The staple lines are removed, the underlying parenchyma is inked\nblue, and the specimen is serially sectioned perpendicular to the long\naxis to demonstrate an irregular 1.0 x 0.9 x 0.4 cm indurated focus with\nwhite-tan glistening cut surfaces. This lesion grossly abuts possible\nvascular and bronchial structures and comes to with 0.2 cm of the\nblue-inked parenchymal margin.  Additionally, the lesion extends to, abuts\nbut does not grossly involve the pleura.  The remaining, uninvolved lung\nparenchyma is brown-tan, soft, spongy throughout. The specimen is\nsubmitted entirely in blocks B1-B3.\n<MICROSCOPIC>\n  A) Sections show a fairly well circumscribed vesicular, cellular\nproliferation of spindled cells which have elongated oval nuclei and\nindistinct cytoplasmic borders.  The tumor is highly mitotically active\nwith up to 42 mitotic figures per high power fields.  Centrally there is a\nfairly broad region of hemorrhage and necrosis. The tumor involves the\npleural surface but does not appear to involve the inked previously\nstapled resection margin.  The non-neoplastic lung parenchyma is\natelectatic, shows vascular congestion and is otherwise unremarkable. \nB) Section show a polypoid bronchial proliferation of cohesive, monotonous\ncells which have uniform stippled chromatin, small nucleoli and a modest\namount of light pink cytoplasm with some cells appearing plasmacytoid. The\ntumor cells are arranged in sheets and trabeculae.  The polypoid\nproliferation distorts the cartilage containing airspaces and incorporates\nthe adjacent alveolar tissue as well.  There tumor has a low mitotic rate,\nno evidence of necrosis and no evidence of cellular pleomorphism. There\nare areas of microcalcification. The immunohistochemical stains for\nchromogranin and synaptophysin decorate the tumor cells and show floating\ncells within alveolar spaces adjacent to the tumor and in a cross section\nof an blood vessel.  This finding probably reflects tumor carry over. The\nresection margin is negative for tumor (tumor is 0.2 cm from the resection\nmargin). The tumor does not involve the pleura (0.1 cm from the pleura).\nThe non-neoplastic lung tissue shows atelectasis, focal mucus plugging and\nvascular congestion. The hyaline cartilage is focally calcified. There are\npleural adhesions. There is no evidence of metastatic leiomyosarcoma. No\nlymph nodes are identified.\n"

Container designation: \"ileocolic anastomosis with tumor (neuro\nendocrine recurrence and perforation)\" --  Received in fixative is a 322\ngram aggregate weight portion of terminal ileum and large bowel. The\nproximal and distal ends (4.5 and 7.5 cm) are inked black and green\nrespectively, shaved and placed en face.  The ileum measures 71 cm in\nlength with an average internal diameter of 4.5 cm.  The surface is dusky\ngray and covered in fibrinous purulent exudate.\nThe portion of large bowel measures 19 mm with an internal diameter of 7.5\ncm.  The external aspect of the large bowel is remarkable for an 8 x 6 x 5\ncm firm mass attached to the surface covered by tan exudate.  A 3.5 x 2 cm\ndefect is noted adjacent to the anastomosis located nearest to the ileum.\nOpening of the ileum reveals a dusky mucosa with normal folded pattern with\nmultiple small possible polyps ranging in size from less than 0.1 to 0.3\ncm.\nOpening of the large bowel reveals a 5 x 4 cm area of ulcerated mucosa\ninvaded by the overlying mass. The perforation site is surrounded by dusky\nbrown mucosa.\nThe mass is located 3 cm from the distal stapled resection margin and abuts\nthe Ileum.  Sectioning through the tumor reveals a staple line with the\ntumor surrounding an area of possible large bowel that has a wall thickness\nof 0.2 cm.\nA scant amount (3 x 2 cm) of pericolonic adipose tissue is palpated for\nlymph nodes and found to be studded with tumor and fat necrosis.  No lymph\nnodes are grossly identified.\nRepresentative sections are placed in 22 cassettes as follows:\nA1, distal margin shaved, (Green) and placed en face;\nA2, proximal margin shaved, (Black) and placed en face;\nA3, proximal margin perpendicular section,\nA4 to A9, representative sections of ileum from proximal to distal;\nA10, area of perforation;\nA11, anastomosis adjacent to perforation;\nA12 to A16, representative of large bowel from proximal to distal;\nA17, distal stapled margin perpendicular section;\nA18-A22, representative of mass surrounding bowel and adjacent to staples.\n\n.\nB.

The ends are\nstapled measuring 4 and 3.5 cm respectively.  Opening reveals a normally\nfolded mucosal pattern, and is remarkable for multiple small (less than 0.2\ncm) possible polyps or nodules scattered throughout the mucosa, that is\nlocated within 0.3 cm of both margins.  The scant amount of adipose tissue\n(8.2 cm) is dissected for lymph nodes and none are grossly identified.\nRepresented sections are placed in 7 containers as follows:\nB1-B2, staple margins inked black and placed en face;\nB3, perpendicular sections of stapled margins;\nB4-B6, representative sections;\nB7, adipose tissue with exudate.\n\n(Dictated by: **NAME[YYY XXX WWW], PA) (Resident:  **NAME[VVV UUU], MD)\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: Histologic examination performed.\n\nThe staff pathologist was present during the formal review and\ninterpretation of all slides and ancillary studies, (if performed), with\nthe medical student or resident.\n\n\n\n**NAME[TTT SSS], MD\nPathologist\nElectronically signed **DATE[Oct 27 2011] 11:56 AM\nSPECIMENS SUBMITTED:\nA.

B) Sigmoid colon, polyp stalk, polypectomy: -    Intramucosal and focally invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma arising within a tubulovillous adenoma; cauterized stalk base resection margin appears benign. C) Rectum, polyp, biopsy: -    Hyperplastic polyp.\nGross Description: Received are three separate formalin-filled containers, each labeled with the patient's name. Part A is additionally labeled \"sigmoid polyp at 25 cm\".  The specimen consists of three irregular pink-tan polypoid tissue fragments, which are 0.7, 0.5, and 2.2 x 1.4 x 1.4 cm.  The largest tissue fragment has its base inked blue and is sectioned.  The two smaller tissue fragments are submitted in toto in cassette A1.  The largest tissue fragment is sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes A2 through A3. Part B is additionally labeled \"sigmoid polyp stalk\".  The specimen consists of a 2 x 1.7 x 0.8 cm pink-tan pedunculated polypoid tissue fragment.  The base is inked blue, and the specimen is sectioned and submitted entirely in cassettes B1 and B2. Part C is additionally labeled \"rectal polyp\".  The specimen consists of a single 0.2-cm white-tan irregular tissue fragment submitted in toto in cassette C. JAB:jg\nMicroscopic Description: A)   The two smallest described fragments show portions of tubulovillous adenoma with focal high grade dysplasia.  The remaining blocks containing the two larger portions of polypoid tissue, demonstrate a large tubulovillous adenoma with a transition to zones of intramucosal adenocarcinoma appearing moderately differentiated.  Focally invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma is noted within the polyp stalk, with the high grade dysplastic changes and zones of intramucosal adenocarcinoma appearing to extend to the inked and cauterized base resection margin for these fragments.  Correlation with the colonoscopic impression is recommended. B)   Sections show a serially divided polypoid fragment of colonic mucosa again demonstrating changes of a tubulovillous adenoma with zones of high grade adenomatous dysplasia transitioning to intramucosal adenocarcinoma, with a small focus compatible with at least superficial invasion into the polyp stalk.  The inked and partially cauterized apparent stalk base resection margin as noted in block 2, and appears free of dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. C)   The rectal biopsy represents changes of an early hyperplastic polyp.

Received in formalin labeled \"right pelvic lymph node\" is a 4.5 x 3.1 x 0.9 cm aggregate of red-pink, lobulated, adipose tissue. Within the tissue four red-pink, rubbery possible nodes are identified ranging from 0.5 cm in greatest dimension to the largest measuring 3.1 x 2.1 x 0.6 cm. The nodes are submitted as follows:  Cassette summary:  1. - two whole possible nodes 2\\T\\3. - one trisected node 4\\T\\5. - one trisected node  B. Received in formalin labeled \"left pelvic lymph nodes\" is a 4.6 x 2.9 x 0.9 cm portion of yellow-pink, lobulated, adipose tissue. Within the tissue, three red-pink, rubbery nodes are identified ranging from 1.3 cm in greatest dimension to the largest measuring 3.1 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm. The nodes are submitted as follows:  Cassette summary:  1 - one trisected node 2. - one bisected node 3-4. - largest serially sectioned node    /pb/sk  C. Received in formalin labeled \"prostate\" is a 54 gram prostatectomy measuring 5.1 x 4.2 x 3.8 cm (lateral to lateral, anterior to posterior, superior to inferior).  There is an attached right vas deferens and seminal vesicle that measure 0.6 x 0.4 cm and 2.5 x 1.8 x 0.8 cm, respectively.  There is also attached left vas deferens and seminal vesicle measuring 0.5 x 0.5 cm and 2.2 x 1.7 x 1.0 cm, respectively.  The remaining prostate is covered by a thin intact fibrous capsule.  The right half is inked black and the left half is inked green and the anterior aspect is inked orange.  Sectioning reveals a multinodular focally hemorrhagic and focally gritty cut surface.  The urethra at the apex is distended due to a protruding nodule on the left half.  A suspicious pink indurated gritty nodule measuring 2.1 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm is located on the right posterior aspect of the mid prostate. A 1.9 x 1.7 x 1.1 cm firm nodule also is within 0.2 cm of the left posterior aspect of the mid prostate.  The remaining parenchyma contains multiple additional pink glistening rubbery nodules.  Representative sections are submitted as follows:  1.  right seminal vesicle and right vas deferens 2.  left seminal vesicle and left vas deferens 3-6.  left base 7-10.right base 11.  apex 12-3 o'clock 12.  apex 3-6 o'clock 13.  apex 6-9 o'clock 14.  apex 9-12 o'clock 15-23.  entire right posterior quadrant submitted sequentially from apex to base 24-27.  suspicious nodular area of left posterior aspect of prostate 28,29.  representative sections of left anterior prostate        /pb/as  \nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION  38 H\\T\\E \nSPECIMEN INFORMATION  A.

This immunoprofile supports the histologic impression of adenocarcinoma.Consult\n**NAME[YYY M.

Right lower lobe, lung, lavage (one ThinPrep slide and cell block sections reviewed):\n-Positive for malignant cells, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma (adenocarcinoma).\n\nd. Lung, right lower lobe, endobronchial biopsies:\n-Fragments of bronchial mucosa admixed with blood and fibrin showing focal non-small cell\n carcinoma (adenocarcinoma); please see comment. \n-Focal erosion with associated acute and chronic inflammation.\nINTRAOPERATIVE DX:\nA. 4R lymph node, fine needle aspiration (immediate interpretation of one smear): Numerous bronchial epithelial cells and a few scattered atypical cells, significance uncertain. \nB. Station 7 lymph node, fine needle aspiration (immediate interpretation of three smears): Atypical cells present admixed with numerous bronchial epithelial cells and lymphocytes, suspicious for non- small cell carcinoma.\n\nConsultation: **NAME[YYY M. XXX], M.D.\nMICROSCOPIC:\nPart A - One wet-fixed smear, one fast-stained smear and cell block sections are reviewed. The aspiration contains numerous bronchial epithelial cells, many ciliated. Scattered within are clusters of atypical epithelial cells with relatively fine nuclear chromatin, round and smooth nuclear membrane and conspicuous nucleoli. Occasional large atypical cells with more clumpy chromatin and prominent nucleoli are focally present. These cells are consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. \n\nPart B - Three wet-fixed smears, three fast-stained smears and cell block sections are reviewed. The aspiration is cellular and contains many clusters and individually scattered malignant epithelial cells, some with nuclear hyperchromasia, irregular nuclear membranes and prominent nucleoli, consistent with non-small cell carcinoma. Numerous ciliated bronchial epithelial cells and a moderate number of lymphocytes are present in the background. \n\nPart C - One ThinPrep slide and cell block sections are reviewed. The ThinPrep slide is hypocellular, while the cell block sections show rare clusters of atypical epithelial cells with large hyperchromatic and vesicular nuclei and occasionally prominent nucleoli; the later are consistent with rare groups of non-small cell carcinoma.\n\nParts B and D:\nImmunohistochemistry Study:\nDeparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue and the appropriate controls are incubated with a panel of antibodies. Localization is via one or all of the following three systems: Alkaline Phosphatase multimer-based method, indirect biotin streptavidin immunoperoxidase method, and biotin free multimer immunoperoxidase method.

The specimen is partially surfaced by a 6.0 x 3.5cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse.  The everted nipple measures 2.0cm in diameter.  The deep margin is black and sectioning reveals nearly exclusively dense white fibrous breast tissue.  No masses or suspicious lesions are appreciated.  Representative sections are submitted.  Summary of Sections: 1A-1I  representative sections of random fibrous breast tissue, 1J  representative section of nipple.   Specimen 2 received fresh for frozen section labeled left sentinel node for frozen section is a 3.0 x 3.0 x 1.8cm aggregate of tan/pink adipose tissue.  Sectioning reveals a single lymph node measuring 1.5cm in greatest dimension.  The node is submitted entirely for frozen section, now resubmitted in cassettes 2A-2B.  The remaining fatty tissue is submitted in cassettes 2C-2D. Specimen 3 received in formalin labeled left breast is a 675 gram per the operating room scale, 20.0 x 18.5 x 5.0cm intact left simple mastectomy specimen.  The specimen is partially surfaced by a 7.5 x 3.5cm tan wrinkled skin ellipse.  The everted nipple measures 2.1cm in diameter.  The margins are inked as follows: superior aspect  blue, inferior aspect  green, and deep margin  black.  The specimen is sent to mammography for radiographing.  There are two needles inserted into the radiographically identified biopsy site.  The needles are 6.5cm apart.  The biopsy sites are arbitrarily designated as #1 and #2 on the radiograph.  The first needle is surrounded by a 2.2 x 1.8 x 1.8cm well-circumscribed tan firm mass, 0.9cm from the deep margin and 1.0cm from the superficial margin.  Located between the two needles is a small firm nodule measuring 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.5cm.  This nodule grossly appears to be completely separate isolated nodule.  The nodule is 3.0cm from the #1 needle biopsy site and 2.5cm from the #2 needle biopsy site.  There is fibrocystic breast tissue between the needles and the small nodule.  The small nodule is greater than 1.0cm from both the deep and superficial margins.  The second needle biopsy site has a 1.5 x 1.2 x 1.2cm well-circumscribed tan nodule, 2.0cm from the superficial margin, and 0.9cm from the deep margin.  Located approximately 2.5cm lateral to the second needle biopsy site is a 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.4cm well-circumscribed tan firm nodule which appears to be fourth area of separate tumor.  The skin and nipple are unremarkable and grossly free of tumor.  There are two lymph nodes identified in the outer quadrant.  Representative sections are submitted.  Summary of Sections: 3A  superficial margin closest to biopsy site #1, 3B-3C  mass at biopsy site #1 to include deep margin, 3D-3E  breast tissue between site #1 and nodule #1, 3F-3G  nodule #1, 3H-3J  breast tissue between nodule #1 and biopsy site #2, 3K  superficial margin closest to biopsy #2, 3L-3M  biopsy site #2 to include deep margin, 3N  breast tissue between biopsy site #2 and nodule #2, 3O  nodule #2 submitted in its entirety, 3P  nipple, 3Q-3R  one bisected lymph node per cassette, 3S  suspicious peripheral nodule.   **INITIALS\nMicroscopic Description Multiple sections from the right breast show stromal fibrosis with some sclerosing adenosis and some ductal dilatation.  Areas of intraductal hyperplasia are seen and some calcifications are identified in benign ducts.  No atypical hyperplasia or malignancy is identified.  Focal fibroadenomatoid change is seen as well.  The nipple shows no pathologic changes. The two sentinel lymph nodes show no metastasis. Sections from the first identified tumor show an invasive ductal carcinoma.  Occasional foci of in situ tumor are seen with central necrosis as well.  No marginal involvement is identified.  Occasional calcifications are identified within the tumor.  Sections between the identified biopsy site and the separate nodule show proliferative fibrocystic changes but no invasive tumor.  The second separately identified nodule does show in situ and invasive low grade carcinoma.  Some fibroadenomatoid change is seen adjacent to this nodule.  The tissue between the newly identified nodule and biopsy site 2 show occasional foci of lobular carcinoma in situ but no invasive lobular or ductal carcinoma is seen.  No marginal involvement is identified.  The second biopsy site shows in situ and invasive carcinoma.  The tumor has low grade histology.  No marginal involvement is seen.  The breast tissue between the nodule second biopsy site and second nodule shows both ductal and lobular in situ carcinoma.  The nodule #2 shows a small biopsy site with foci of in situ carcinoma but no invasive carcinoma is seen.  The nipple is free of in situ or invasive tumor.

Mass, Right Axillary, Excision:\nHistologic and Immunohistochemical Features Consistent with Extensive Metastatic Carcinoma Consistent with Metastatic Metaplastic Ductal Adenocarcinoma with Squamous Differentiation. \n\n2.  Skin, Left Breast, Excision:\nBenign Polypoid Skin. \nNo Diagnostic Histologic Evidence of Malignancy.\nGrossDescription:\n  Container 1. Received in formalin labeled \"mass of right axilla, history of mastectomy\" is an 11.0 x 5.0 x 3.5cm aggregate of tan to pink, rubbery tissue. There are no definitively identified lesions. Representative tissue is submitted in 1A thru 1H. \n\n  Container 2. Received in formalin labeled \"left breast skin, history of mastectomy\" ae two irregular portions of white, wrinkled skin. There are no noted lesions. Representative tissue is submitted in 2A. \n\nFixation of specimen reviewed and assured to be between 6 to 48 hours. \nAC:fmg **DATE[Mar 29 2013].\nMicroscopicDescription:\n  Sections of axillary mass reveal histologic features of extensive infiltrating (invasive) carcinoma consistent with metastatic metaplastic ductal adenocarcinoma.  Preserved lymphoid tissue is not noted. Comparison is made with pathologic findings of the previous right mastectomy sample from this patient (S10 18360). The mastectomy sample revealed extensive in situ and invasive poorly differentiated ductal adenocarcinoma with focal spindle cell (sarcomatoid) and metaplastic features. In this sample, focal squamous differentiation was identified. \n\n  The current right axillary soft tissue sample reveals extensive invasive metaplastic carcinoma with squamoid differentiation. \n\nImmunohistochemical Studies:\n  Immunohistochemical stains are performed on sections of tumor from the current sample (block 1B) to include CK56, CK20, E Cadherin, mammoglobin, P16, CK7, ER, PR, Ber Ep4, TTF1, AE1, AE3, and Hercept. Tumor cells are positive for AE1, AE3, CK7, P63, and CK56. Moderate expression of E Cadherin is noted. Invasive tumor cells are negative for ER and PR as well as Hercept (similar to the immunophenotypic profile noted in the original sample (right mastectomy S10 18360). \n\nComment:\n  This case was reviewed for a consensus diagnosis through intradepartmental consultation and at the daily pathology QA conference on **DATE[Mar 30 2013]. \n\n1: Soft tissue submitted for? tumor.\n2: Breast skin (left)\n"
